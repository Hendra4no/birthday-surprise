You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<p>Welcome to the first ever DevBootcamp DevCast! DevCast is a conversation about the beginner’s experience of learning how to learn, how to code, and how to build meaningful software.</p>
<p>In this episode, DBC’s <a href="https://twitter.com/quackingduck">Myles Byrne</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ChapmanSnowden">Chapman Snowden</a> talk about building your “toolbox” as a beginner web developer. You’re toolbox can mean a number of different things - mental strategies, resources, code snippets. But like any tool, the magic isn’t necessarily the tool, but in how you use it.</p>
<p>During the episode we reference this awesome talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShEez0JkOFw">Programming with Hand Tools by Tim Ewald.</a></p>
<p>Let us know what you think or share topics you’d like to see covered in future episodes by tweeting to us <a href="https://twitter.com/devbootcamp">@DevBootcamp</a>!</p>

<p>Internalizing this switcheroo is maybe one of the single most important lessons for a student. At first glance, the words “code” and “learn” are merely shuffled around a bit. And you’re right of course. But for most people who have 12-20 years of traditional schooling behind them, who live in a culture where everything from grades to careers to computers and car engines is about performance, it’s not a simple switch.</p>
<p>At DBC, we try hard to fight the frustrations that students experience when their code doesn’t immediately “perform” according to their expectations. A student might have spent hours assuming their code works one way, only to discover that it breaks every time they try to make a minor adjustment. And it’s that precise moment, when a student may be so frustrated that they’re ready to punch the screen, that the “Code to learn” mantra is crucial.</p>
<p>Our teachers try to sit down with the student and probe their mental model of the problem. And instead of reprimanding them for not “performing”, turn their frustration into a sense of discovery and joy when they realize that their mental model of the problem is wrong.</p>
<p>Yes, discovery and joy. Because that realization is what learning is. It’s getting closer to really understanding the problem at hand. And correcting a student’s mental model of it.</p>
<h2>Learning how to Learn</h2>
<p>One of our biggest mission is to try to get students to unlearn mental habits and attitudes that prevent them from learning and growing.</p>
<p>Part of that is also peeling away at assumptions students have about themselves as learners. What does it mean to be “smart”? Is that even the right question to ask in the first place?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.stanford.edu/dept/psychology/cgi-bin/drupalm/cdweck">Carol Dweck’s</a> theory of the <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">fixed vs. growth mindset</a> underlies a lot of this probing. Dweck, a Stanford psychologist, makes a radical claim: that cultivating a passion for learning, rather than a hunger for approval, can profoundly affect our success, motivation and most importantly, our capacity for happiness. She differentiates between what she calls a “fixed mindset” and a “growth mindset”.</p>
<p>The first is reflected by statements like “I’m not smart enough for this”, or “Wow, you’re so intelligent for solving this so quickly”. These statements assume that our intelligence is tied to our performance and that it’s static. Success thereby becomes an affirmation that we’re smart, so we strive to avoid failure at all costs and put ourselves into situations that affirm our “ability” (i.e. we avoid hard problems and challenges, even if we might learn from them).</p>
<p>Contrast this to a “growth mindset”, which assumes that we can stretch ourselves and learn new things with attention and deliberate practice. A person who cultivates a growth mindset sees challenges as potential for growth and failure as an opportunity to learn.</p>
<p>Aside from presenting her research, we try to create an environment where students don’t feel ashamed or judged when they struggle with a problem, but rather happy to be attempting it in the first place.</p>
<p>It’s not always easy, especially because so many students have a lifetime of performance-driven classroom experiences behind them. And they live in a society that makes quick judgments about them based on their performance and success. But we want DBC to be an experience that has the potential to be life-changing. Not merely in terms of teaching students a new set of coding “tools”, but a new way of engaging problems and their own capacity to learn from them.</p>

<h1><a href="/2014/02/07/calling-all-apprenticeship-programs/">Calling all Apprenticeship Programs</a></h1>

<p>tl;dr - If you have ever participated in a formal apprenticeship program as a mentor or an apprentice, I'd like to ask you a few questions to inform my writing. You can reach me at <a href="mailto:dave@devbootcamp.com?subject=Apprenticeship%20Programs%20blog%20post">dave@devbootcamp.com</a>.</p>
<p>In August 2007, I wrote <a href="http://redsquirrel.com/cgi-bin/dave/craftsmanship/a.call.for.apprenticeship.html">a blog post</a> that called for more companies to start apprenticeship programs. I had just started an apprenticeship program at my company and had experienced great results so far. I <em>knew</em> that there were a lot of great companies that could help themselves by engaging with the legion of overlooked and not-quite-employable programmers spread throughout the country.</p>
<p>Since then, apprenticeship programs have gradually proliferated, though I'm not really sure how widespread they are. I'm a Chicagoan, so when I say that it seems like Chicago has more apprenticeship programs than other cities, I'm immediately skeptical of that assertion.</p>
<p>It's the same skepticism I felt when I started writing <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html">Apprenticeship Patterns</a>. I initially based the patterns exclusively on my own experience, and then after getting feedback and advice from my early reviewers, I started interviewing other people about their experiences. I wanted to find out which of my "patterns" were truly patterns (common solutions to common problems) and which were just my idiosyncratic experiences. These interviews allowed my <a href="http://www.oshineye.com/">co-author</a> and I to test our tentative patterns against a better representation of reality.</p>
<p>After a successful year of launching Dev Bootcamp in Chicago, it's time for me to get back to writing again, and this time I'm not writing for apprentices. This time I'm writing for the team leaders, the CTOs, the mentors, and the software shop owners who are interested in growing their own talent.</p>
<p><strong>This is a call to the pioneers!</strong> I want to talk to the <em>leaders</em> who have forged ahead to start apprenticeship programs. I want to talk to the <em>apprentices</em> who took a risk on these early programs. I want to learn from your experiences. I want to interview you, possibly use your stories in my writing, and gather a critical mass of collective wisdom on the topic.</p>
<p>Please reach out to me at: <a href="mailto:dave@devbootcamp.com?subject=Apprenticeship%20Program%20blog%20post">dave@devbootcamp.com</a>.</p>
