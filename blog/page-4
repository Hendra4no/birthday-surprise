You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.

<p>We are proud that our alumni are building amazing apps at hackathons all over the Bay Area. This summer and fall Dev Bootcamp graduates have helped build apps to discover the spread of solar energy through neighborhoods, track Bills as they are debated in Congress, engage with lowering our carbon footprints on a social level, add another competitive layer to the NFL draft, and make non-profit websites mobile-friendly.</p>
<p>This week we want to shine a light on some of the apps they've been building and send out our congratulations on their creativity and success:</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2><a href="http://solarhackathon.challengepost.com/submissions/17335-wattsun">WattSun</a></h2>
<p><em>Winner, Most Technical, at <a href="http://sfuncube.com/hackathon/">SfunCube Solar Hackathon</a></em></p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/hackathons/wattsun1.png" alt="Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<p><em>This app offers social context about why solar is a great choice by providing users a local map that shows just how many other people nearby are already using solar. And it helps guide you through the financial and environmental benefits of going solar.</em></p>
<p>The app grew out of an <a href="http://sfuncube.com/hackathon/">SfunCube Solar Hackathon</a>, an event that brings together programmers, designers, and businesspeople with the goal of accelerating solar energy adoption. Participants work together to "make it easier, more efficient, and more enjoyable for people to power their lives with sunshine." Great mission!</p>

<p>.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.beagle.pw">Beagle:</a></h2>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/hackathons/beagle.png" alt="Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<p><em>"Beagle helps you share the progress of a Bill, its current status, and provides links to more resources by giving you a code snippet to embed the Bill wherever you want."</em></p>
<p><em>"O, Say Can You See!"</em> We love this idea to track progress on Bills in front of Congress easier from anywhere on the web. It grew out of <a href="http://lincolnlabs.com">Lincoln Labs'</a> Liberty Hackathon, which set out with the goal of “promoting liberty with the use of technology." As <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/06/26/what-really-happened-at-the-right-wing-hackathon/">PandoDaily</a> put it, "the organizers, participants, and judges all shared a common belief in the power of the private sector to improve peoples’ lives."</p>

<h2><a href="http://binaryskipper.tumblr.com/post/54329193690/tech-soup-to-go-a-mobile-transformation">TechSoup.org: Mobile</a></h2>
<p><em>Runner Up to 1st Place Prize in #Hack4Good by <a href="https://geekli.st/home">Geeklist</a></em></p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/hackathons/techsoupmobilefull.png" alt="Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<p><em>"I chose to try to make a mobile site for <a href="http://www.techsoup.org/">Tech Soup’s website</a> and make their catalog more accessible on mobile. I decided to use the <a href="http://www.moovweb.com/">Moovweb</a> framework after being shown a demo/tutorial of how the platform worked to transform HackerNews, a very non-mobile site, into a mobile site. It was interesting to me to see the Tritium language in use because it very much looked like a mix of jquery and css selectors with scopes and methods."</em> -- <a href="http://binaryskipper.tumblr.com/post/54329193690/tech-soup-to-go-a-mobile-transformation">Stephen Nguyen</a></p>
<p>It's always rough when you take out your phone, pull up a site, only to find that… the mobile version isn't so great. At this summer's #Hack4Good by <a href="https://geekli.st/home">Geeklist</a>, hosted by <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/">Pivotal Labs</a>, Stephen Nguyen, Stephane Thomas, and the Moovweb team worked to make the <a href="http://www.techsoup.org/">TechSoup</a> site mobile-friendly.</p>
<p>Team: <a href="https://github.com/stephenitis">Stephen Nguyen</a> worked with fellow DBC grad <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasstephn">Stephane Thomas</a> and others on the Moovweb team.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2><a href="http://cleanandgreenhackathon.com/results/">Footprint</a></h2>
<p><em>2nd place in the <a href="http://cleanandgreenhackathon.com/results/">Clean and Green Hackathon</a> at <a href="http://blog.rally.org/tag/rallypad/">Rallypad</a> in San Francisco</em></p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/hackathons/cleanandgreen.jpg" alt="Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<p><em>Most Carbon footprint calculators give you suggestions on what to do. There is a lot of Data Entry Required. But none right now, do a good job at motivating or engaging to pursue lowering your carbon footprint. We set up feasible way to send information from other apps like "Move" and other apps and compete against your friends to lower your Carbon Footprint.</em></p>
<p>Last June President Obama gave a speech saying, <em>"A low-carbon, clean energy economy can be an engine of growth for decades to come. And I want America to build that engine. I want America to build that future -- right here in the United States of America. That’s our task.”</em> That speech was the catalyst for the Clean and Green Hackathon, asking participants to build apps based around 1) Expanding local energy resources, 2) Reduce Energy Consumption at Home and at Work, and 3) Data Visualization and Mashups.</p>

<h2>Fortune Rookie, 2nd place &amp; Venmo prize at the <a href="http://ondeckcupsf.challengepost.com/submissions/18129-fortune-rookie">On Deck Cup Sports Hackathon</a></h2>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/hackathons/fortunerookie.png" alt="Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<p><em>This app allows users to play along with the NFL Draft via a "stock market." Players who can successfully predict whether a player will be picked in the first round are rewarded with prizes.</em></p>
<p>Fantasy Football leagues have gone a long way toward adding another layer of sport and intrigue to the NFL season. This app offers yet another chance for armchair quarterbacks and coaches to test their wits between seasons by treating the draft itself like a sort of stock market. Winning multiple honors at the <a href="http://ondeckcupsf.challengepost.com/submissions/18129-fortune-rookie">On Deck Cup Sports Hackathon</a>, we wouldn't be surprised if this app helps the competition stay just as wonderfully tense in the off season as it does on game day.</p>

<p>Cheers to you all for making it happen!</p>

<p>Last week we <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/2013/10/03/what-the-world-looks-like-after-180-days-of-websites/">wrote about Jennifer Dewalt</a>, who undertook the incredible "learn by doing" project of building 180 apps in 180 days. Last Friday we were proud to celebrate with our graduates who will take what they have learned at Dev Bootcamp and make amazing things happen out in the world.</p>
<p><em>It's amazing what builders can do when we put our minds to it and make it happen.</em></p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/final-projects/dbc/dbc-class-panoramic-2.jpg" alt="Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<p>Since we can't invite everyone to our amazing our internal demo day, here's an inside look at what they have been building:</p>
<h2>Greenlight</h2>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/final-projects/dbc/greenlight.png" alt="Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<p>A dating service that help you find singles in your immediate vicinity, in real-time. When you allow our geolocation services on the app, you'll immediately be redirected to other singles just a short distance away. You have a choice: you can give them the greenlight, or pump the brakes! If someone you've "green lighted" hits you back, you're notified, and then have the option to meet up immediately.</p>

<p>.</p>
<h2>SiteKick</h2>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/final-projects/dbc/sitekick.png" alt="Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<p><a href="http://sitekick.herokuapp.com/">SiteKick</a> helps bloggers take their digital publishing skills to the next level. After logging in with a Tumblr account, a user can use siteKick to examine the structure and content of his or her most recent posts. The app gives each post a score and suggests improvements based on SEO best practices.</p>
<p>Team: Luisa Emmi Beck, Alex Fiore, Gabriela Zamudio, and Dan Apczynski</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>OpenNGO</h2>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/final-projects/dbc/openngo.png" alt="Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<p>OpenNGO supports the open-information initiative of HelpArgentina, an Argentine charity working to strengthen Argentina’s social sector. This website will provide donors and other socially-minded citizens unprecedented access to data on Argentine non-profits. Users can search for organizations and read about their programs, teams, financials and more. The site’s clean layout, solr-powered search, developer API and .xls download features all enhance the organization’s mission of increased NGO transparency.</p>
<p>Team: Lloyd Nimetz, Doktor Gurson, Lily Jarusvasunt, Alejandro Barbero</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Jailbird</h2>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/final-projects/dbc/jailbird.png" alt="Dev Bootcamp"/></p>

Whether you've lost your phone or it's out of juice, find the nearest phone and access the numbers you need the most. Call a single person or send your customizable groups an SMS or voice blast. Great in a pinch or for sharing great news with friends and family quickly.</p>
<p>Team: Alex Flores, Nick Saldivar, Elaine Tsai, Charlie Young</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>NewsShark</h2>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/final-projects/dbc/newshark-new.jpg" alt="Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<p><a href="http://news-shark.herokuapp.com/">NewsShark</a> delivers news articles on topics important to you. You can create "channels" to listen for relevant stories, and you rate the ones that you like or dislike. Over time, your channel learns about your preferences and delivers customized recommendations based on article characteristics such as author, publication, word-count, keywords, readability metrics, and more. Utilizing our own in-house machine learning system and content-ranking algorithm, NewsShark does for the news what Pandora does for music: we filter out the noise.</p>
<p>Team: Ian Root, George Pradhan, Christian-Robert Joseph, Thomas Landon</p>

<p>A few months ago, we <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/2013/07/29/5-things-180-websites-in-180-days-can-teach-us/">posted</a> about Jennifer Dewalt. Jennifer was a new coder who had chosen to learn by challenging herself to create a new web application every single day for 180 days - six full months.</p>
<p>She knew she wanted to learn by doing. She knew she wanted to accelerate her way through the learning process. She knew she wanted to pull in the ideas and expertise of others.</p>
<p>Her strategy was one which kept her on the edge of her comfort zone for a significant period of time, but which created a momentum and, it seems, a community of interest and support that many others would have loved to have when learning to code - or really, learning anything.</p>
<p>Her interest came from her background in fine art. Dewalt <a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/62998082815/after-180-websites-im-ready-to-start-the-rest-of-my">wrote</a> that, in effect, her interest in art was about how people communicate, and she wanted to be literate in the communication medium of the future.</p>
<p>Her journey took her from very <a href="http://jenniferdewalt.com/make_a_deal.html">basic websites</a> with just CSS and Javascript to Rails sites to <a href="http://jenniferdewalt.com/todo/todos">Backbone apps</a> and eventually opened up doors to building games, toys, <a href="http://jenniferdewalt.com/tweet_time/page">API driven apps</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Every day, she wrote a little note about what she did, and released everything publicly on GitHub.</p>
<p>It's one of the more inspiring approaches to self-learning we've seen. Definitely take some time and <a href="http://jenniferdewalt.com/">check it out.</a></p>
