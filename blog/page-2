<p>Who is the best teacher you've ever had? What made them great? Which lessons did you learn from them, whether or not those lessons were written on the syllabus?</p>
<p>These and other questions are on my mind quite a bit these days. I like hearing stories of incredible teachers because it helps me clarify what exactly it is that I can look for. Over the next few months, I'm <strong><a href="http://devbootcamp.com/jobs/">hiring a new team of teachers</a> for our New York City location</strong>. This is not a simple endeavor.</p>
<p>In the process of recruiting and interviewing, I've noticed that <em>most people have no idea how we teach here at Dev Bootcamp</em>. When we post that we are hiring teachers, that can be interpreted in a variety of ways. Are we looking for lecturers or tutors? Guides or explorers? Masters of a particular craft or facilitators of an exceptional learning environment? The answer to all of these questions is "yes".</p>
<p>Which is, admittedly, exceptionally confusing. So let me attempt to clarify just <strong>what it means to be a teacher at DBC</strong>.</p>
<p>In broad terms, being a teacher here means guiding and activating student learning, deepening one's own knowledge of education and programming through deliberate practice, and building out a new kind of educational model with a community of like-minded and passionate people. Let's tackle each of those in turn.</p>
<h2>Teacher as Guide</h2>
<p>Information is cheap and ubiquitous. What is rare and valuable is the skill to discover, filter, and integrate the most useful and pertinent information. A teacher who merely acts as a deliverer of information is not very useful, while other elements of teaching are becoming increasingly important: mentoring, counseling, and guiding, to name a few.</p>
<p>Guiding and activating student learning is the abstraction layered on myriad concrete activities designed to provide students with the richest project-based learning environment we can create.</p>
<p>These activities include coding challenges, group discussions, topical lectures, guided inquiry, feedback, reflection, mentorship, modeling by example... and quite a few more. Being a teacher means having access to a large toolbox of pedagogical tools and methodologies which can be applied to the appropriate learning opportunity.</p>
<p>The crucial distinction here is that teachers at Dev Bootcamp prioritize student exploration and discovery over transmission of knowledge. In other words, we believe that what makes a teacher an expert is not so much the size of their vault of relevant knowledge and experience (although that is certainly valuable and valued), but is rather their ability to nurture students' ability to seek out, discover, and integrate knowledge, wherever the source of that knowledge may be.</p>
<p>To put it simply, a teacher doesn't copy and paste knowledge. They lead and facilitate the exploration and discovery of it.</p>
<p>This is why I prefer the analogy of a trail guide over the archetype of a classroom instructor. A guide's job is to prepare their team for the unexpected, to give them the tools to survive and adapt in new terrain and unfamiliar conditions. A guide who does nothing more than teach you how to follow a well-marked trail and survive in temperate weather is not much of a guide.</p>
<h2>Teacher as Learner</h2>
<p>Occupying the role of a teacher is a position with no small amount of authority and leadership. A good teacher is a good leader in the sense that they are empathetic and demonstrate the qualities they encourage their students to emulate.</p>
<p>A teacher who demonstrates curiosity, humility in the face of vast unknowns, integrity in their words and actions, a passion for learning, and the perseverance to solve complicated problems will be more effective in provoking these behaviors in their students.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that we look for teachers who don't see themselves as being at the zenith of their education, but who see education as a lifelong practice. As best we can, we try to nurture an environment where teachers can learn openly in front of their students and where students are encouraged and empowerd to take on the role of a teacher to themselves and their peers.</p>
<p>At this point I am realizing that my claims must sound quite hallow and high-minded. It is all well and good to proclaim intent, but do we actually walk the talk?</p>
<p>Well, yes. We do. And we have a long way to go and we are constantly improving. Two things we are doing right now:</p>
<p><strong>Paid professional development.</strong> In between periods of teaching students full-time, teachers at Dev Bootcamp are encouraged to take 3 weeks of paid professional development time to improve themselves as teachers and as programmers. Instead of expecting teachers to learn on their own time, we aim to establish persistent learning as an integral part of the structure of the organization.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback and transparency.</strong> Feedback is a fundamental theme throughout Dev Bootcamp, for students and teachers. Students are taught how to give specific, actionable, and kind feedback. Everyone practices soliciting, giving, and receiving feedback. It is a skill. We believe it to be one of the most useful skills. As teachers, we practice that skill and use it in just about every interaction and activity, cultivating an environment where the status quo is vibrant growth.</p>
<p>Is it a bit chaotic? Well, yes. Intentionally so. Evolution happens at the fringes. Staying safe, dry, and comfortable is antithetical to real learning.</p>
<h2>Teacher as Innovator</h2>
<p>The final piece of being a teacher at Dev Bootcamp is a bit more nebulous. It stems from the fact that our business is sailing into relatively uncharted territory.</p>
<p>That sounds presumptuous. Let me clarify what I mean.</p>
<p>Apprenticeship is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship#Development">not new</a>. In fact, it may well be one of the oldest forms of structured, skill-based education. So in the sense that we are a type of apprenticeship program, that is not new territory. Trade schools have been doing this for a while, with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>Likewise, creative ways of teaching people computer programming is not that new either. A lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">really</a> <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/">smart</a> <a href="http://www.papert.org/">people</a> have worked on fascinating new educational methods to teach what is increasingly becoming an essential skill for the modern economy.</p>
<p>Within the established academic world there have also been all kinds of innovative ideas sprouting up from creative clusters like <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/">MIT's Media Lab</a> and the <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/">ITP program at NYU</a>. A simplistic view of educational institutions as backwards and obsolete doesn't give proper credence to the real innovations occuring within the academy.</p>
<p>As much as we respect and admire them, we do not quite fit into any of these three categories. At Dev Bootcamp, we <em>are</em> doing something different. We <em>are</em> innovating.</p>
<p><strong>We practice and envision an education that addresses students as whole people whose personal, social, and technical growth are interdependent and best addressed holistically.</strong></p>
<p>Unless I'm sorely mistaken, most schools don't approach learning in this way.</p>
<p>In moving towards this relatively unknown domain, we have to maintain an innovator's mind. Failing often and learning from our failures. Becoming <em>connoisseurs of our own mistakes</em>, to quote the philosopher <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett">Daniel Dennett</a>.</p>
<p>As teachers are at the core of our culture, they are crucial components of this innovative endeavor. Teachers are experimenting, ideating, creating, innovating. We may not always agree on where to go, but we share commitment to a common goal: creating the best immersive learning environment possible.</p>

<p>With 2013 winding to a close, we reformat our pairing workstations and sweep up the assortment of odds and ends left behind by all of the colorful characters who have graced the halls of DBC this past year.</p>
<p>Before we look ahead to 2014 we wanted to thank our community of students, teachers and employers who helped make this year such a success.</p>
<p>Below is a list of happenings that made us all proud to be a part of the DBC family in 2013.</p>
<h2>1. From Teach for America to Dev Bootcamp to $40k IndieGoGo Campaign</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VPdgtrH.png?1?2310" alt="swot bot"/></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rwarbelow">Rachel Warbelow</a> is a middle school teacher in Las Vegas who came to DBC Chicago this past summer. She started her career with Teach for America, and six years later created the SWOT (scholars working overtime) program to prepare first generation students for college.</p>
<p>After learning to code this past summer, she built a <a href="https://github.com/rwarbelow/the_swot_bot/tree/master">classroom management system</a> to help keep her students informed and engaged on their classroom progress. But she wasn’t done yet. She wanted to expose her students to the art of programming, but the school didn’t have the resources for a computer lab. Like any good innovator, she wouldn’t let these barriers stop her and started teaching them with pencil and paper until fellow DBC Alum, Eric Allen, helped her raise <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/a-computer-lab-for-the-scholars-working-overtime-team--2">$40,000</a> with an indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p>If you haven’t seen the video of this story, take a few minutes and watch it <a href="http://vimeo.com/76302820">here</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Coding Challenge Sends Ryan Gosling App Viral</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xxLZGPc.jpg?1?2852" alt="hey girl.io"/></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/keccers">Katherine Champagne</a>, another DBC Chicago student, was given a coding challenge to manipulate web page elements live with Javascript. She thought it would be fun to play off of the Ryan Gosling Hey Girl meme and ended up building a chrome extension which turns all of the images on a web page into one of many Mr. Gosling portraits.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://heygirl.io/">HeyGirl.io</a> was not only a hit with her classmates, outlets like <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/08/13/hey-girl-chrome-extension/">Mashable</a> and the Times thought it was worth sharing. While the app may not be world changing, Katherine was quoted in mashable saying “I hope that heygirl.io inspires more woman to get into web development - there needs to be more of us, ladies! It’s not all math, it’s not boring - as I hope heygirl.io evidences. I’ve found programming to be an incredible creative outlet.”</p>
<h2>3. DBC Grad Receives 2014 Code for America Fellowship</h2>
<p><a href="http://annamarie.me/">Anna-Marie Panlilio</a>, an accomplished artist-turned-DBC Chicago student, was chosen as one of 600 applicants to win a <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/fellows/2014-fellows/#panlilio">2014 Fellowship at Code for America</a> this year.</p>
<p>Code for America is an innovative program who aims to change how citizens participate in government by designing better services, encouraging low-risk settings for innovation and supporting a competitive marketplace for “civic tech.”</p>
<h2>4. DBC Grad Wins Ideation Nation to Help Get People Outdoors</h2>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/Boots/alyssa-camping.jpg" alt="hipcamp alyssa"/></p>
<p>Speaking of Civic Tech, <a href="https://twitter.com/alyraz">Alyssa Ravassio</a> was tired of the hassle it takes to get accurate information on which campsites she should choose from various websites. So after graduating from Dev Bootcamp, she decided to follow her passion for the outdoors and build <a href="http://www.hipcamp.com/">HipCamp</a> in order to help get more people outdoors.</p>
<p>After launching her new company and the app she won this year's <a href="http://www.govtech.com/local/25-Tech-Ideas-that-Might-Solve-a-Community-Problem-.html">Ideation Nation</a> challenge to help improve local communities which is sponsored by Code for America and Mindmixer. Alyssa is a perfect representation of the passionate, multi-talented students Dev Bootcamp attracts describing coding as a practice for her, just like yoga or surfing.</p>
<h2>5. DBC Grad Wins Best Yahoo! Product Hackathon Award</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/52zmj23.png?1?4328" alt="flickrpedia screenshot"/></p>
<p>While our alumni have gone on to win numerous hackathons, one of our top winners from this year was comprised of three DBC grads, <a href="http://scrapandrun.blogspot.com/search/label/DBC">Colleen McCloskey</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/fabianuribe">Fabián Uribe</a>, and Martino Visentin who built “Flickrpedia.” Flickrpedia is a way to spruce up the “walls of text” on Wikipedia with beautiful images from Flickr. It won Yahoo’s Best Use of a Yahoo! Product award and was featured in the <a href="http://yahoodevelopers.tumblr.com/post/62748207228/yahoo-hack-usa-its-a-wrap">Yahoo blog post</a> summarizing the event.</p>
<h2>6. DBC Chicago Teacher Takes Special Dev Project in Libya</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JxE316K.jpg?1?6085" alt="libya graffiti"/></p>
<p>Of course it’s not only our students who continually amaze us, but our teachers are quite an impressive bunch as well. <a href="https://twitter.com/abi">Abi Noda</a>, recently took a special development project in Libya which he describes in detail on his <a href="http://abinoda.com/rebooting-libya">personal blog</a>. After recovering from a bout of food poisoning in Nicaragua, he received an email from a former colleague asking him to build a voter registration website in Libya.</p>
<p>The project involved him being flown into the country and working with locals in order to create a website in both English and Arabic (one read left to right and the other right to left) so that out-of-country voter registrations could elect the constituents responsible for drafting Libya’s constitution and setting the stage of a general election.</p>
<p>He was inspired by “the potential for positive change - economic, cultural, and political - through arming younger generations with the capacity and mindset to innovate in-country”, and we certainly were inspired by his work and reflection on the project.</p>
<h2>7. Founder Shereef Bishay Drops Knowledge on Bloomberg TV</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/db32Do4.png?1?3917" alt="shereef bishay on bloomberg"/></p>
<p>Back here in America, <a href="https://twitter.com/shereefb">Shereef Bishay</a>, founder of Dev Bootcamp was interviewed on Bloomberg TV on how we can reduce the unemployment rate in America. The December Jobs Report showed a slight improvement in the unemployment rate, but there are still an estimated 150,000 technology jobs unfilled because of the technology skills gap in America.</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/81248305">Watch Shereef explain</a> how programs like Dev Bootcamp can help reduce the skills gap, create jobs, and provide a most efficient alternative than “traditional higher education" or read why the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323884304578328243334068564">The Wall Street Journal</a> says [a Smart Investor Would Skip the MBA].</p>
<h2>8. Dev Bootcamp Chicago Opens its doors and Rocks First Year Employment Numbers</h2>
<p>Speaking of jobs, this past year DBC Chicago opened its doors and graduated over 145 students across 9 cohorts. Their employment results were quite impressive with 85% of their first five cohorts employed, with the average salary in the $70k range.</p>
<p>These new junior developers landed jobs at top companies in Chicago like Groupon, Sprout Social, Instructure, Eight Bit, BrightTag, and NCSA. They also went on to other cities such as San Francisco, Austin, Boulder, Minneapolis and New York.</p>
<p>Hats off to the amazing students, teachers and staff we have in the Windy City!</p>
<p><img src="http://media.cdn.builtinchicago.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/Large/images/dbc_grad_love.jpg" alt="DBC Chicago graduation"/></p>
<h2>9. Dev Bootcamp New York Announced!</h2>
<p>2013 was a tremendous year of growth for our students, our internal team and with our new locations in Chicago and now New York City. We’re thrilled to begin our first NYC cohort in March of 2014 and join the ranks of numerous other innovative companies such as Etsy MongoDB, FourSquare to MakerBot, and Kickstarter.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/tannerwelsh">Tanner</a> writes in his <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/2013/10/30/Announcing-Dev-Bootcamp-New-York-City/">announcement post</a> “There are many, many other reasons that we love being in New York City, too many to list here. The city is vibrant and bursting with potential, full of creative people and innovative ideas about education, technology, and the myriad ways that they intersect.”</p>
<h2>10. First Annual Alumni Holiday Hackathon a Huge Success</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/odlZ5y1.jpg?1?9717" alt="dev bootcamp holiday hackathon"/></p>
<p>With over 400 alumni now in the DBC family, we thought what better way to celebrate the holidays than to have a hackathon? Over 40 alumni came to the San Francisco office on December 14th for a 24-hour hackathon filled with holiday cheers.</p>
<p>Projects ranged from a <a href="https://github.com/brunops/aMazeng">Javascript 3-d game</a> to a <a href="http://bootietracker.herokuapp.com/">map of where DBC students currently are</a> (according to LinkedIn data) all over the country. Perhaps the best part of the hackathon came when one of the judges pulled an alumni off the side and said, “My company is working on a similar problem you are solving with that app. Any interest in a job?”</p>
<p>Thanks for all the alumni who came out and participated as well as a shout-out to <a href="https://twitter.com/ChapmanSnowden">Chapman Snowden</a> who made it all happen.</p>
<h2>11. "Rolling Cohort" Model Launched in January of 2013</h2>
<p>At the end of 2012 Dev Bootcamp theorized there was a better way to educate the same amount of students. In the start of the new year we brought the agile development approach to our curriculum and launched our rolling cohort model which starts student down the three weeks of Phase 1, 2 and 3 every three weeks.</p>
<p>This benefited our students and the program in a few areas:</p>
<p>1.<b> Pace</b> - by starting new phases every three weeks we can maintain an extremely fast paced course while also allowing for a student who might struggle for any number of given reasons the opportunity to repeat a phase (for free).</p>
<p>2.<b> Peer learning</b>- by surrounding students with peers who are slightly above or below their skill level a highly collaborative mentorship culture forms improving the learning of both parties.</p>
<p>3.<b> Agile Curriculum</b>- after each three week phase our students provide feedback which allows us to improve our delivery and also allows us to keep up with new developments in the wonderful world of software.</p>
<h2>12. Phase 0 Added to Improve the Student Onboarding Experience</h2>
<p>One of our other big changes this year was the addition of <b>Phase 0</b>, a 60 day instructor-guided virtual prep that makes sure all our students hit the ground running as soon as they arrive for Phase 1. This also allows our teachers to cover more technical topics at a deeper level during the 9-week immersion program while also introducing students and teachers to one another through challenges and pair-programing sessions.</p>
<h2>13. Dev Bootcamp Adopts Holacracy</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZPb3AWA.png?1?4125" alt="Medium's Holacracy collection"/>
While little has been published about this thus far, in 2013 Dev Bootcamp implemented Holacracy, following other organizational leader such as <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com.au/zappos-adoption-of-holacracy-2013-12">Zappos</a> and <a href="http://firstround.com/article/How-Medium-is-building-a-new-kind-of-company-with-no-managers">Medium</a>. Holacracy is described as "an operating system for an intelligence organization" which allows for any individual within a company the chance to address "tensions" (the difference between how things should be vs. how things are) in an open, non-threatening, and non-hierarchical way</p>
<p>In order to maintain our autonomy and productivity with a growing team we hope to avoid management bottlenecks that often plague traditional organizations.</p>
<h2>What Did We Miss?</h2>
<p>No doubt 2013 will go down as a great year in Dev Bootcamp's young history, but are there any big stories we missed?</p>
<p>Let us know on <a href="https://twitter.com/devbootcamp">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/devbootcamp">Facebook</a> and best of luck to you and your learning in 2014!</p>

<h2>14. Dev Bootcamp Chicago Grads Head to the Whitehouse</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HPhEZL7.png?1?6161" alt="department of labor challenge"/></p>
<p>One story we missed was a final project which recently won the US of Department of Labor <a href="http://fairlabor.challengepost.com/">Fair Labor Data Challenge</a>. The project asked for submissions for an innovative tool that let’s consumers know if a local business is following the law when it comes to paying workers fairly. A team consisting of <a href="http://twitter.com/pri1229">Priya Mathew</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/keccers">Katherine Champagne</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/mbacksmeier">Mark Backsmeier</a> built <a href="http://laborsight.com">Laborsight.com</a> which won first place and will be sending the team to Washington DC to meet with the Federal CTO, US Secretary of Labor and the US Chief Innovation Officer.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/brunops">Bruno Sanches</a> a recent DBC grad, usually flies a little under the radar - he’s pretty quiet, but undoubtedly the type of guy who responds with positive enthusiasm whenever asked to do something.</p>
<p>Knowing that, we all shouldn’t have been surprised that he built <a href="https://github.com/brunops/aMazeng">aMazeng</a> last week in 24 hours. While he was presenting it, the collective 100+ years of programming in the room went, “Whoa…”</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Eknnaqa.png?1" alt="maze game"/></p>
<p>The screenshot doesn’t do the project justice. Bruno created a regenerative maze (you get a unique maze every time) using a depth first search algorithm. The program defines the maze’s space with no walls, then divides the space with randomly positioned walls, each containing a randomly placed opening. The algorithm recursively calls itself until all the spaces created by the walls reach a minimum size. Oh, and the real-time positioning (and ultimate winner) is created with Node.js using socket.io.</p>
<p>That’s why we love Dev Bootcamp. We have those moments with so many Boots like Bruno - that moment when you just stand in amazement, marveling at how a Boots has so cleverly masked a program’s complexity in utter simplicity. It’s those moments that led us to hold our First Annual Alumni Holiday Hackathon.</p>
<p>Over the past year, we’ve had roughly 350 Boots attend DBC in San Francisco, bringing that number up to 450 over our 2 year history. Too often our Boots only get to program with the cohorts immediately before or after their own. So we asked, what would happen if we brought together alumni from across all cohorts together for a weekend of hacking?</p>

<p>To put it simply, it was beautiful. Our alumni came together over 24 hours, formed 9 teams, and showed us exactly what a roomful of current and former world class beginners are capable of (when given some computers, food and hours of Christmas music.) One team, <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/schemap">Schemap</a>, wrote a Ruby gem that uses the D3 library to visualize your database schema.</p>
<p>Another group, <a href="http://waneka.github.io/middle/">Middle</a>, created a simple yet powerful solution to that inevitable question of “Where should we meet?” by suggesting locations equidistant from two parties.</p>

<p>We had a group, <a href="http://salarkhan.com/face-off/">FaceOFF</a>, bravely tackle the three.js library and, after creating their own physics library, create a 3D Javascript game.</p>

<p>While the alumni and judges were impressed with all the projects, what’s more impressive is what those projects represent. Remember that 100 years of programming I referenced a bit back? Well all of the alumni in the room represented a quarter of that total.</p>
<p>We’re all still incredibly new to this, and yet how far we’ve come over our respective journeys is nothing short of remarkable. We can’t wait to see what will come from our next Alumni Hackathon, especially as we add Chicago and New York alumni to the mix.</p>
