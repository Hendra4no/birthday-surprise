You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<h2><strong><em>"In the world we live in now, knowing how to build makes you unstoppable."</em></strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>-- Zack Shapiro</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/learning-programming-top.png" alt="Pathways to Programming"/></p>
<p>Today we'll hear from Zack Shapiro in the first interview of our <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/learning%20programming/2012/11/30/learning-programming/">Pathways to Programming</a> series, where we talk to formerly non-technical people about how they learned to program in a non-traditional way and what they're doing now.</p>
<p>Less than a year ago Shapiro decided to stop being "the product person without the coding skills" and learn to code. Now, he's an engineer with <a href="http://www.taskrabbit.com">TaskRabbit</a>. That's inspiring.</p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.com/imgs/blog/shapiro-zack.png" alt="Zack Shapiro"/></p>
<h2>Who are you? Tell us about yourself.</h2>
<p>I'm Zack Shapiro. I'm an engineer at TaskRabbit. I started learning to code in March 2012, took an internship at TaskRabbit in June and was brought on full time in September. I graduated from the University of Colorado with a degree in journalism in December 2011.</p>
<p>While I was in college, I started an iPhone app company, released 4 iOS apps and created a basketball culture around college basketball at CU which led to a 700% increase in attendance. The last few years have been diverse and interesting, to say the least.</p>
<h2>What were you doing before and what made you decide to code?</h2>
<p>I was always the product person without the coding skills. I would do everything except the code and that wasn't personally fulfilling.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I had so many ideas and realized very early on that learning to code would be the fastest way to get those ideas out of my head and into the world in some fashion.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>After a few times starting to learn and quitting, I got really serious about teaching myself and figured that an internship would be the best way to go about that, just to throw myself in. I'm also sick of everyone who's "looking for their technical co-founder" and eventually treats the tech lead like a second-class citizen. I wanted to be able to build the first part of the product, that attracts talent of all kinds when you're trying to form a team.</p>
<h2>How did you learn? What resources were most valuable? What surprised you?</h2>
<p>I did a Rails book called <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/"><em>The Rails Tutorial</em></a> as a starting place but didn't really understand it all until I started my internship at TaskRabbit. I knew loosely how it all worked together but once my feet got held to the fire, the epiphanies started coming. I also wrote a blog post about this called <a href="http://zackshapiro.com/post/31672964808/want-to-learn-rails-start-here">"Want to Learn Rails? Start here."</a></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Personal projects are great because you can get out of the material and think about it on your own.</em>
That's really where you learn.</p></blockquote>
<h2>What have you been doing with it?</h2>
<p>I've been focusing my time on TaskRabbit where I work on the business services team. We're working on the TaskRabbit experience for business users, specifically. I do some personal projects on the side that won't see the light of day, just to play with concepts and technologies that I'm curious about but right now, TaskRabbit is my jam.</p>
<h2>What were some of the biggest mistakes you made?</h2>
<p>I think I started rushing through things when I was first starting out. In some senses, I'm still rushing. Software, like companies, people - everything, really - is built in a million little steps. You don't ship a feature you started on yesterday, you ship it in a week or two weeks or a month. Going slow and understanding each piece is important for when those pieces pop up later. I don't think I did a great job of that to start.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>When you start personal projects, have fun with them.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Start really small. You don't have to build Facebook on your first try (or your twelfth). Make something you want and don't care if anyone sees it. Use it to build your skills. Practice.</p>
<h2>What were some of the biggest obstacles you found outside the actual learning?</h2>
<p>Getting frustrated with errors, StackOverflow being useless sometimes, problems that I blew out of proportion. Errors are clues, they tell you where X is so you can go find that spot and start there (most of the time). You'll learn pattern recognition with errors and be able to find them much more quickly as you go along.</p>
<p>Some answers on StackOverflow are great, a lot of others are absolute crap written by people who don't know what they're doing but like to pretend they do. Don't take them as gospel.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I used to make the fact that I couldn't make something work a much bigger deal than it needed to be.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Step back, go for a walk. The answer usually comes when I'm not staring at it.</p>
<h2>How do you find your life different emotionally speaking?</h2>
<p>My brain is constantly churning on new ideas that I want to build now. I have a growing list on my computer - which is great. I'm approaching problems in a much different way. Stress is still there but it's a stress that can be combatted with working code, problems solved.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I'm constantly excited to learn new tricks and ways of going about things to build software better, faster, more efficiently.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Where are you headed?</h2>
<p>I'm going to start some more companies one day. Right now I'm focused on becoming a great engineer, building as much as I can. Writing a lot of code, that's the only way you get better. In the world we live in now, knowing how to build makes you unstoppable. You can build the tools you want, you can build the tools you need to build the tools you want. I'm always looking for great people to work with, people who are generally inspiring.</p>
<p>The future's looking bright, I'm excited to see where the road is headed.</p>
<h2>Any closing notes to people just learning programming?</h2>
<p>Write a lot of code. It's the only way to get better. Great painters were great, not because they were born great, but because they painted a lot. There's some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbC4gqZGPSY">Ira Glass quote</a> about how where you are now and where your taste is are two very different places. You most likely suck in comparison to what you want to exist when you create things. That's fine. Embrace that. You'll get there. The people that quit are the ones who can't get over that what they're doing now doesn't reflect their taste.</p>
<p>Feel free to <a href="mailto:zack@zackshapiro.com">email me</a>, let's grab coffee. I'd love to be a resource as someone who was in a similar situation not too long ago.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>To paraphrase Muhammad Ali, Be the champ the way you want to be the champ, not the way anyone wants you to be.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Do what you want. Have fun. It never hurt anyone. Don't be too serious all the time; enjoy writing crappy code making things that barely work. Where you are now and where you will be in a year are night and day.</p>
<p>Find technical mentors. Ask them a lot of questions. Find ones that scare you. Basically anything that scares you, that's a great indicator of the direction you should lean. I hope the road treats you well. Go get em. -- ZS</p>
<p><strong><em>If you've taken your own unconventional path to becoming a programmer, we'd love to hear about it. Send a short email to <a href="mailto:scott.james@devbootcamp.com">scott.james@devbootcamp.com</a> and let's talk.</em></strong></p>
