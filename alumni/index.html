You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

I was having a hard time getting a firm grasp on programming on my own, but knew it was something I wanted to do. Dev Bootcamp seemed to be exactly what I needed - a passionate, collaborative environment that focused on learning by doing. I was also hoping to leverage this experience to live/work abroad. The program far exceeded my expectations. A few months later, I find myself in Paris, starting my first job as a web developer with a great team, more excited than ever about what's to come. I love this stuff.

I attended DevBootcamp with the goal of being able to work on the products that I love, with the people I've aspired to work with, and Dev Bootcamp has delivered both in the last three months. In addition to the flurry of job interview requests from the very companies I admire, I've come out with knowledge of a world I was completely unaware of before: the nuances of technical implementation that runs "under the hood" of all web applications. It's a new landscape I'm bound to explore extensively in the future.

Despite earning 3 degrees, I wasn't making the money I needed to support my family. I really couldn't afford to go back for another degree from a money or opportunity cost standpoint. At Dev Bootcamp, not only did I learn to write good code in 10 weeks, but the skills I learned around coding &mdash; pairing and communication &mdash; were specifically listed as the reasons that I received multiple, strong job offers. These are skills that I wouldn't have learned in a traditional educational environment and at a pace that worked for me and my family.

I don't think it's possible to learn on one's own what I learned at Dev Bootcamp, regardless of the time spent. Dev Bootcamp's emphasis on collaborative projects and paired programming have given me skills that are invaluable in the workplace: I know what it takes to meet a ship date, how to code alongside another person, and collaborate with a team of developers possessing a diverse set of skills and backgrounds. My code improved tremendously at Dev Bootcamp, but these latter skills will make all the difference wherever I go next.

After 3 years into my career as a chemist, I decided it was time for a change. I didn't like the repetitive nature of my work so I wanted to learn how to program. I was having trouble staying positive whenever I was stuck learning a concept. I knew I needed help. One day I read about DBC and knew it was the perfect opportunity. DBC taught me more than just how to write code. I learned how to work well in a team and how to resolve conflicts.Anyone who goes through DBC will definitely be surprised by how much they actually learn in such a short amount of time.

On my second Monday at my new job, I realized that I could do it. I was learning a ton and being exposed to code and concepts I'd never encountered before, but I knew, without a doubt, that I could do it, and that I loved it.</p>
<p>On my first day at Dev Bootcamp, I realized that the program is about so much more than just learning to code. For me, it was about finding fulfilment in craftsmanship and the ability to produce, and developing a deeper sense of connection with myself and my peers.

Dev Bootcamp has simply changed my entire life. Three months ago I was a working in spreadsheets all day everyday, feeling as if every morsel of creativity and self-expression was being ground out of me. Now, I have an expanse of options and opportunities available to me, each one being a chance to solve real and complex problems and make an impact on the world. In fifty years, when I look back on what I've accomplished, I'll know the exact moment my life pivoted for the better.

I came into DevBootCamp looking to become just good enough at programming to build prototypes and mockups for the startup I intended to start. I left with a bonafide passion for programming, the skills to build what I wanted to (and a LOT more), and a wonderful network of friends, mentors and colleagues. I expected to learn how to program at DBC, but I didn't expect to learn even close to as much as I did or to have had so much fun with such great people along the way.

Often in life things sound really great beforehand and then turn out to be less than promised or expected. Dev Bootcamp turned out to be much much better than I had hoped for. I came in looking for an environment that would engage and push me everyday. This was delivered big time.</p>
<p>It was pretty much the best, most compact learning experience of my life. I wish they'd offer intermediate and advanced courses, I'd do one every year. </p>
