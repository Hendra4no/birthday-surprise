<p><em>Tanner Welsh, my co-conspirator here in NYC, wrote an <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/2013/10/30/Announcing-Dev-Bootcamp-New-York-City/">inspiring blog post</a> last Wednesday to announce our launch. Please read his first; our posts are intended to be read together.</em></p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, we opened the floodgates to DBC::NYC applicants, and it’s been thrilling to see how many are applying. As these highly accomplished people make the courageous leap of faith to become professional geeks, I’ve noticed myself starting to feel heightened levels of adrenaline and anxiety. It’s show time!</p>
<p>So you might ask: <em>“Why any anxiety? Dev Bootcamp has already been highly successful in San Francisco and Chicago accepting a small % of applicants, graduating 450 people and achieving ~90% employment rates at an ~$80k average salary within 3 months. You just have to replicate this tried-and-true model in NYC.”</em></p>
<p>First of all, replicating the original, magical learning culture of Dev Bootcamp San Francisco is hard. Very hard. As any great teacher knows ever so well, you can’t just replicate all the intangibles that bring people to life… that make people capable of pushing far beyond their comfort zones and do things they’ve never dreamed possible… a culture that breaks down self-imposed barriers to learning. Earlier this year, Dave and his team did it in Chicago so I’m very confident we can do it again in NYC, but it’s a herculean undertaking with thousands of moving parts. Shereef and all the members of the DBC team are some of the most gifted and dedicated educators and web developers I’ve known. They are also some of the most authentic people I’ve ever worked with. Their blood, sweat and tears are what have made DBC a success so far so it looks like Tanner and I will be loosing a lot of bodily fluids over the next year.</p>
<p>I’m writing this blog to answer a question that a lot of my friends are asking me: <em>“Why are you doing this?”.</em> Here are my primary reasons:</p>
<p><strong>To close the employment gap for software developers.</strong> Unemployment is one of the biggest issues in the US, Europe and world today yet companies are simultaneously desperate to hire software developers. Go to any software company’s job board, and you’ll see that most of the job openings are for software developer positions. Our society is simply failing to educate enough people to fill these roles, and it’s hurting our economy. Dev Bootcamp is the most direct and practical way to solve this issue. Through a very rigorous, hands-on learning process, the students gain incredible breadth and depth of knowledge and practical skills turns them into high-performing contributors on the job. One of our star Chicago teachers, Kevin Solorio, told me a couple weeks ago that he fell in love Dev Bootcamp and took the job because he realized that the students were learning in 9 weeks what it took him almost 1.5 years to learn in his CS degree. Amazing! Over the last two years on average, 90% of our graduates have accepted job offers within 5 months. The model works. I’m a graduate of the program too and got a job web developer job offer on graduation day. I knew I wanted to join Dev Bootcamp full time so I declined, but it was pretty cool to receive a job offer from a beloved, publicly-listed company even though I wasn’t looking for one.</p>
<p><strong>To unleash people’s full potential.</strong> Just as many people say that their college years were some of the best years of their life, I think that Dev Bootcamp is also some of the best 9 weeks of many of our student’s lives. It was for me. For the last 18 years – basically since high school -- I have wanted to code but never thought I could or never thought I would be able to learn. Now, I’m not only coding, but I feel confident in doing so. I can walk into any hackathon and contribute. Let’s be clear I’m a rookie, but I’m comfortable in the hacker community. Beyond the newfound skills and confidence, I also built life-long friendships. I got to know myself so much better. I cried with grown men and women on a regular basis as if they were life-long friends. (Yes, you will cry at Dev Bootcamp. It’s part of the rite of passage.) I overcame things and learned skills that I never thought I would or could. In summary, I, and so many of our graduates, got a taste of our full potential. Once somebody experiences this, they are transformed forever.</p>
<p><strong>To close the gender gap in the software development industry.</strong> Tanner and I want to achieve gender-parity in our student admissions => 50% women. Looking at the numbers, most would argue this is impossible. There are deep cultural norms and institutional sexism at play making gender diversity in the software engineering second worse only to the mining industry. According to Payscale.com, 90% of web developers are men. Despite SF &amp; Chicago’s already strong diversity efforts initiatives, many more men still apply to Dev Bootcamp than women. This will change. It has to. We are making gender parity one of our top priorities in NYC, and we will invest whatever time and resources needed to achieve it as quickly as possible. It’s time to be the change. I’m very aware and am reminded every day that gender parity in our student admissions appears as feasible as the Jets winning the Superbowl this year (read: really, really low probability based on the fact that they’ve never given me a Superbowl win). But, I’m stubborn. I’m counting on a minor-miracle to happen. Are you my miracle? If so, don’t be shy. Please reach out.</p>
<p><strong>To join a new tribe.</strong> In just two short years, Dev Bootcamp has become a very tight-knit extended community. Alumni are feeling a similar sense of deep belonging that they feel for their high schools or colleges. Our alumni stay in close touch and even come back to mentor, teach or just hangout. In a new era when people don’t know their neighbors anymore, affinity groups like DBC give people a sense of belonging and a sense of community. It’s a beautiful thing. As boots continue to graduate every three weeks, DBC is becoming much more than a web development bootcamp. It’s becoming a tribe… and a quirky, awesome one at that.</p>
<p><strong>To build the first high-credentialed vocational degree.</strong> Today, most vocational schools have very poor reputations in society. They tend to be dry, technical programs that fail to inspire students. Overall, the US educational system is in a massive crisis and major transformation is needed. Luckily necessity is the mother of invention. I believe that in the next five years hiring managers will respond no differently to the Dev Bootcamp credential on a resume than they currently respond to prestigious degrees like Stanford, Harvard or Williams (I had to plug my alma-mater -- go Ephs!).</p>
<p><strong>To build a model of change that scales globally.</strong> Dev Bootcamp pioneered this bootcamp teaching model: intensive, apprenticeship, short-format. In less than two years the model has already been replicated by 40+ companies in the US and abroad. This is really only the beginning. It’s only the beginning because the model is far from perfect. In fact, every three weeks we internally make adjustments (sometimes quite major changes) because there is so much opportunity for improvement, and we believe deeply in continuous improvement. It also only the beginning because every month a new bootcamp opens up somewhere in the world (…and by the way, we totally encourage it). Just as the micro-finance model was replicated by thousands of organizations and just as it took almost 40 years before Mohammad Yunus won the Nobel peace prize, our bootcamp educational model will also take decades, thousands of bootcamp organizations across the globe and hundreds of millions of graduated geeks. (Hopefully, Shereef will win the Nobel peace prize!) I’m looking forward to quite a ride ahead.</p>
<p><strong>To serve as a success story for a new order of mission-driven businesses.</strong> Only one out of every four Americans is engaged at work. That means that 75% of working Americans don’t feel fulfilled and engaged by their work. That’s most of their waking hours. This statistic exemplifies just one of the failings of our current capitalistic system. And yet very little is really being done about it. Most people do want to seek out better ways to do business that appeal to both their conscience AND their wallet: an approach that puts purpose ahead of profit. More double bottom line businesses like Dev Bootcamp need to succeed and serve as role models for different ways to run purpose-driven organizations. Just as we’re experimenting with new educational models, we’re equally experimenting with new management and governance models (e.g. check out <a href="http://holacracy.org/">Holacracy</a> which we started implementing three weeks ago).</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Dev Bootcamp graduates go out into the world with a strut… with a super-power, with deep new friendships, and with a better sense of themselves. They go out transformed and on the brink of highly meaningful professional careers in software development. So… <em>Why am I doing Dev Bootcamp?</em> I can’t imagine doing anything else.</p>
