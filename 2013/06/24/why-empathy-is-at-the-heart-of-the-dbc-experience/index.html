You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<p><em>Ed. Note:</em></p>
<p><em>Our admissions team gets a huge array of questions about the Dev Bootcamp experience. What will I learn? What types of positions will the program qualify for? What backgrounds do students tend to come from? How intense will this be, really?</em></p>
<p><em>Some of the questions we get most regularly are about why we talk about empathy and how it relates to our philosophy of teaching. Karim, our Head of Admissions, prepared some answers to these questions that we thought were worth sharing with our broader readership.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>Hi DBC applicant!</p>
<p>I'm Karim Bishay, Head of Admissions for Dev Bootcamp. We get asked a lot about our teaching philosophy and why empathy is so important to us. I put together answers to two of the most common versions of this question to help you better understand one of the most important subjects we hope to engage our students.</p>
<h2>QUESTION ONE: What do students learn at DBC?</h2>
<p>There are three areas of learning that we focus on at DBC, which we believe, together, best prepares students for dynamic careers as programers.</p>
<ol>
<li>True technical knowledge</li>
<li>Self-awareness</li>
<li>Empathy</li>
</ol>
<p>True technical knowledge means that students should know why they're writing each and every line of code they type. DBC is a no-memorization zone. The problem with most CS degrees isn't that they only teach the "fundamentals", it's that they do it divorced from the reality those fundamentals rest on. You can't be a programmer without understanding both.</p>
<p>We are determined not to graduate "code monkeys" at DBC, who just know some syntax and fundamentals and can type up a program. We want our students to start a deep and sincere dive into the art and science of code, and that's something we look for in our applicants: people who are passionate about the craft above all else.</p>
<p>Self-awareness means that students are aware of their own internal motivations, thoughts, feelings, and confusion. They're clear about what they know and don't know. They know what's frustrating them and why and can communicate that effectively with their teammates.</p>
<p>Empathy means that students are aware of their fellow students' motivations, thoughts, feelings, and confusion.
We work directly and consciously with students on self-awareness and empathy through our Engineering Empathy program.</p>
<h2>QUESTION TWO: What is Engineering Empathy?</h2>
<p>We believe most software projects fail for human reasons, not technical ones. So while true, deep technical understanding is necessary for the success of a software project, it's nowhere close to sufficient.</p>
<p>Engineering Empathy is a philosophy and an approach that we have developed to make sure that weâ€™re training our students to become better at learning, working in teams, and dealing with whatever their job or life throws at them. We've crafted and are always improving on our Engineering Empathy curriculum. Both the content and delivery mechanisms of the curriculum are being continuously updated to better prepare people who will be extremely effective in deploying their technical skills inside teams at some of the world's best technology companies.</p>
<p>Engineering Empathy consists of:</p>
<p>Workshops<br>
Morning check ins with groups and instructors.<br>
Materials and Exercises to support the work done in workshops<br>
A counselor available at the school to work with the students on any of these issues and more.<br>
The workshops specifically tailored to exploring certain key topics: <br>
Giving, receiving, and integrating great feedback.<br>
Dealing with the Super Ego, or our internal critic.<br>
Vulnerability and emotional intelligence as tools for empowerment and intimacy.<br>
Privilege, sexism and other forms of institutionalized and internalized oppression.<br>
Team culture, and how to effectively communicate and learn/teach in a team setting.</p>
<p>To put it simply, Dev Bootcamp only wants to graduate students who have a real technical understanding. This means students who really grok what's going on and haven't just memorized a bunch of APIs. That's a given, but it's not sufficient.</p>
<p>We also want them to be able to give and receive feedback effectively, to work on a team effectively, and to make any team they work on better than if they they weren't there. We believe self-awareness and empathy are the two key components to making this happen.</p>
