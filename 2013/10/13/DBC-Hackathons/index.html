<p>We are proud that our alumni are building amazing apps at hackathons all over the Bay Area. This summer and fall Dev Bootcamp graduates have helped build apps to discover the spread of solar energy through neighborhoods, track Bills as they are debated in Congress, engage with lowering our carbon footprints on a social level, add another competitive layer to the NFL draft, and make non-profit websites mobile-friendly.</p>
<p>This week we want to shine a light on some of the apps they've been building and send out our congratulations on their creativity and success:</p>

<h2><a href="http://solarhackathon.challengepost.com/submissions/17335-wattsun">WattSun</a></h2>
<p><em>Winner, Most Technical, at <a href="http://sfuncube.com/hackathon/">SfunCube Solar Hackathon</a></em></p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/hackathons/wattsun1.png" alt="Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<p><em>This app offers social context about why solar is a great choice by providing users a local map that shows just how many other people nearby are already using solar. And it helps guide you through the financial and environmental benefits of going solar.</em></p>
<p>The app grew out of an <a href="http://sfuncube.com/hackathon/">SfunCube Solar Hackathon</a>, an event that brings together programmers, designers, and businesspeople with the goal of accelerating solar energy adoption. Participants work together to "make it easier, more efficient, and more enjoyable for people to power their lives with sunshine." Great mission!</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.beagle.pw">Beagle:</a></h2>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/hackathons/beagle.png" alt="Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<p><em>"Beagle helps you share the progress of a Bill, its current status, and provides links to more resources by giving you a code snippet to embed the Bill wherever you want."</em></p>
<p><em>"O, Say Can You See!"</em> We love this idea to track progress on Bills in front of Congress easier from anywhere on the web. It grew out of <a href="http://lincolnlabs.com">Lincoln Labs'</a> Liberty Hackathon, which set out with the goal of “promoting liberty with the use of technology." As <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/06/26/what-really-happened-at-the-right-wing-hackathon/">PandoDaily</a> put it, "the organizers, participants, and judges all shared a common belief in the power of the private sector to improve peoples’ lives."</p>

<p><em>"I chose to try to make a mobile site for <a href="http://www.techsoup.org/">Tech Soup’s website</a> and make their catalog more accessible on mobile. I decided to use the <a href="http://www.moovweb.com/">Moovweb</a> framework after being shown a demo/tutorial of how the platform worked to transform HackerNews, a very non-mobile site, into a mobile site. It was interesting to me to see the Tritium language in use because it very much looked like a mix of jquery and css selectors with scopes and methods."</em> -- <a href="http://binaryskipper.tumblr.com/post/54329193690/tech-soup-to-go-a-mobile-transformation">Stephen Nguyen</a></p>
<p>It's always rough when you take out your phone, pull up a site, only to find that… the mobile version isn't so great. At this summer's #Hack4Good by <a href="https://geekli.st/home">Geeklist</a>, hosted by <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/">Pivotal Labs</a>, Stephen Nguyen, Stephane Thomas, and the Moovweb team worked to make the <a href="http://www.techsoup.org/">TechSoup</a> site mobile-friendly.</p>
<p>Team: <a href="https://github.com/stephenitis">Stephen Nguyen</a> worked with fellow DBC grad <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasstephn">Stephane Thomas</a> and others on the Moovweb team.</p>

<h2><a href="http://cleanandgreenhackathon.com/results/">Footprint</a></h2>
<p><em>2nd place in the <a href="http://cleanandgreenhackathon.com/results/">Clean and Green Hackathon</a> at <a href="http://blog.rally.org/tag/rallypad/">Rallypad</a> in San Francisco</em></p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/hackathons/cleanandgreen.jpg" alt="Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<p><em>Most Carbon footprint calculators give you suggestions on what to do. There is a lot of Data Entry Required. But none right now, do a good job at motivating or engaging to pursue lowering your carbon footprint. We set up feasible way to send information from other apps like "Move" and other apps and compete against your friends to lower your Carbon Footprint.</em></p>
<p>Last June President Obama gave a speech saying, <em>"A low-carbon, clean energy economy can be an engine of growth for decades to come. And I want America to build that engine. I want America to build that future -- right here in the United States of America. That’s our task.”</em> That speech was the catalyst for the Clean and Green Hackathon, asking participants to build apps based around 1) Expanding local energy resources, 2) Reduce Energy Consumption at Home and at Work, and 3) Data Visualization and Mashups.</p>

<h2>Fortune Rookie, 2nd place &amp; Venmo prize at the <a href="http://ondeckcupsf.challengepost.com/submissions/18129-fortune-rookie">On Deck Cup Sports Hackathon</a></h2>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/hackathons/fortunerookie.png" alt="Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<p><em>This app allows users to play along with the NFL Draft via a "stock market." Players who can successfully predict whether a player will be picked in the first round are rewarded with prizes.</em></p>
<p>Fantasy Football leagues have gone a long way toward adding another layer of sport and intrigue to the NFL season. This app offers yet another chance for armchair quarterbacks and coaches to test their wits between seasons by treating the draft itself like a sort of stock market. Winning multiple honors at the <a href="http://ondeckcupsf.challengepost.com/submissions/18129-fortune-rookie">On Deck Cup Sports Hackathon</a>, we wouldn't be surprised if this app helps the competition stay just as wonderfully tense in the off season as it does on game day.</p>

<p>Cheers to you all for making it happen!</p>
