You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<h2><em>"The beautiful thing about being with 15 other people that are trying to change their lives is that you can’t help but live as your fullest self."</em></h2>
<h3><em>-- Christopher Sell</em></h3>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/Boots/dbc-class-panoramic.jpg" alt="Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<p>Dev Bootcamp students share a common love for coding, but how each individual student came to that love is always a unique story. In our <em>Boots on the Ground</em> series we invite the "boots" who are currently at Dev Bootcamp to share some of their personal story.</p>
<p>Today we hear from Christopher Sell, who is making the transition to coding from product marketing management. He talks about learning the technical skills to build the first versions of his ideas, learning more than he thought was possible, and how being at Dev Bootcamp pushes him to work on what he loves.</p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/Boots/christopher-sell-pic.png" alt="Interviewee Name Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<h2>Quick Facts</h2>
<p><strong>Age: 24</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hometown: Barrington, Illinois</strong></p>
<p><strong>Most recent work: Product Marketing Manager, Google Chrome</strong></p>
<hr/>
<h2>Tell us about you. How do you describe yourself?</h2>
<p>I am a nerdy Midwestern dude that is trying to build meaningful products.</p>
<p>I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago playing lots of sports and trying too hard in school. I went to Northwestern in Chicago and studied political science because I enjoy Dr. Strangelove. I hit my entrepreneurial stride at NU and started Ecco Living, an environmentally friendly supplies business.</p>
<p>Next I took a stab at the Interwebs and built a social gift giving app called <a href="http://www.presentbee.com">PresentBee.com</a>. We raised seed money, won NUVC, and had 1500 lovely users, but fizzled out after a year.</p>
<p>I took a job in the Google Associate Product Marketing Manager program and kept trying to learn how to build apps on the side. You can check out all my <a href="http://www.elevatortospace.me">appilicious endeavors here</a>. Then I came to Dev Bootcamp.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I always want to do more, to be more and to build more.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>That is how I came to be here.</p>
<h2>Why are you switching careers and why did you choose Dev Bootcamp?</h2>
<p>I want to be a better entrepreneur. I see Dev Bootcamp as the next step in my journey to get there.</p>
<p>While working at Google was fantastic, I wanted to focus more on building the hard technical skills I had been slowly building up over the last year. To start a company I need the right team, concept, skills, and money. I went to DBC to start learning the technical skills necessary to build the first versions of my ideas.</p>
<h2>How is your transition going?</h2>
<p>I took a personal leave from Google on the Friday before I came to DBC. That Monday it felt a bit like I was in the Twilight Zone for the first day. I quickly found that DBC is a natural fit for me.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I like to work on what I love until I am too tired to think. Dev Bootcamp is the first place I have ever been that allows for that, encourages it, and pushes me even further.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Were you coding before you got here?</h2>
<p>I built the frontend for PresentBee a couple years ago. I also built <a href="http://bragtaggs.com">BragTaggs.com</a> and <a href="https://www.challenj.me">Challenj.me</a> from the ground up before I got to DBC. I only was able to do BragTaggs by following <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Michael Hartl’s tutorial</a> with a fine-toothed comb though. All in all I had about 1 year of off and on rails and frontend experience going in.</p>
<h2>What do you do when you’re not coding?</h2>
<p>I try to acquire users for the apps I am building to see what they like, dislike and how I can make the apps better. When I’m less boring I go golfing, but many people would say that is boring too. Like my girlfriend. Hmm... I have to come up with something better.</p>
<p>I do love biking to the ocean over by Cliff House. Riding up to the Marin Headlands is one of the most spectacular feelings I have ever had.</p>
<h2>How is your experience at Dev Bootcamp going?</h2>
<p>My experience at Dev Bootcamp has been excellent overall. I have built more than I ever thought I could have, I have learned more than I thought was possible, and I have met amazing software engineers and human beings at DBC. I knew I needed a place like DBC to structure my learning. But, I didn’t expect it to accelerate my learning as fast as it has.</p>
<p>It is the best $10k+ I have ever invested in anything.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The beautiful thing about being with 15 other people that are trying to change their lives is that you can’t help but live as your fullest self.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Any closing thoughts for someone considering applying?</h2>
<p>You are reading this blog because you are considering applying to a coding program. To me that means you have latent human potential stored away. It’s time to release it. It won’t be easy. It will be terribly painful at times. But, that is what living is all about.</p>
