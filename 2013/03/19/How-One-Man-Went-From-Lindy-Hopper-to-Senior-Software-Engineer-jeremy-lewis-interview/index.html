You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<p><strong><em>"The more you learn, the more you understand about how little you know."</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>-- Jeremy Lewis</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.com/imgs/blog/sf-streetcar.jpg" alt="Dev Bootcamp INTERVIEWEE name Interview"/></p>
<p>Today we hear from Jeremy Lewis, Senior Software Engineer at Open Table where he works on the future of eating.</p>
<p>After graduting from UC-Berkeley with a degree in chemical engineering, Lewis spent years working odd jobs before sitting down with the question of what to do next. He tried programming on a friend's suggestion and loved it, working his way up from a customer service rep to a Director of Engineering position through five years of late nights, increasing challenges, and constant learning. We talk with him about the importance of having great engineers around you as you learn, the value of intense practice, and whether gaming or coding is more rewarding for him.</p>

<h2>Who are you? Tell us about yourself.</h2>
<p>Like one on of my early idols Richard Feynman, I am a curious character. I'm strongly motivated by a desire to learn and better myself in everything I do.</p>
<h2>What were you doing before? What made you decide to code?</h2>
<p>After (eventually) graduating from Cal with a chemical engineering degree, I spent the better part of my twenties working odd jobs: movie theater box office, poker dealer (&amp; player), non-profit bookkeeper. Really though, I was spending my time lindy hopping and generally slacking off.</p>
<p>When my lindy hopping days had wound down, and I was both bored at work and tired of making $30k/yr, I began to consider what might be next. My dear friend Jeffrey Wescott suggested I learn how to code- he thought I would be good at it, enjoy it, and be well paid for it. He suggested learning either Java (more widely used but less "fun") or Python, and I'm so thankful I chose the latter.</p>
<h2>How did you learn? What resources were most valuable? What surprised you?</h2>
<p>Initially, I went to a bookstore and bought a big book on Python, and began working through the material and exercises. Shortly after, I got my foot in the door at Slide as a customer support rep, with the intention of eventually becoming a developer. After about a year, I was promoted into QA, testing the first generation of Facebook applications. I got emails for every changeset, and would try to puzzle out what was happening in each commit.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Reading that much code day in and day out rapidly increased my understanding, and also renewed my interest in learning Python. When I couldn't figure out what was happening in the Slide codebase, I had a couple of friendly engineers who would patiently answer my questions.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Eventually (and with help) I worked out how to build a webpage for internal testing. From there, I could tinker and play around with web development while building useful tools for the QA team. With a development environment set up, I could also play around with editing the Slide codebase in a safe way. At that point, I had all I needed to learn on my own, with some pointed advice/assistance from the developers when I got stuck.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If it's not already obvious, the two most valuable resources were a development playground (so perfectly named) and senior developers who were willing to answer my questions, no matter how basic or stupid.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In more recent years, the web has become a rich resource; sites like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> are invaluable time savers.</p>
<h2>What have you been doing with it?</h2>
<p>About two years after starting at Slide, I asked for (and got) the opportunity to port the SuperPoke Pets! app from our MySpace implementation to Facebook. It was essentially my first project as a developer, and I had never done anything nearly as big before. I had no idea how long it "should" take, and I knocked it out in a couple of weeks. From that point on I was a software developer, eventually being promoted to lead engineer. When I began to feel that there was no more room for growth and learning, I left for another social gaming startup. There I used the Django framework for the first time, and was exposed to the operations side of things. The web server was demystified for me, and I really grokked for the first time the whole lifecycle of a web request.</p>
<p>In August 2010, a former boss and mentor at Slide recommended me as employee/engineer #1 for a startup being co-founded by a couple of Stanford GSB alums. I built and maintained the <a href="https://www.treatful.com/">Treatful.com</a> website (and eventually the Treatful merchant iPhone app) over the course of two years, and we were acquired by OpenTable in August 2012. I am now overseeing the integration of the Treatful experience into the OpenTable application.</p>
<h2>What were some mistakes you made or challenges you faced?</h2>
<p>Where to begin... The most embarrassing mistakes generally resulted in downtime. I once ran a batch script on the Slide.com production server with the wrong settings, generating >1000 API calls in 15 s. (instead of 1500 s.), which backed the site up for 10-15 minutes. As release engineer I deployed code with a circular import, taking the website down for 10-15 minutes. I once accidentally overwrote a whole table in our QA database by running a MySQL update without a where clause. And on, and on...</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Conceptually, the biggest challenge was grokking object oriented programming.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I had dabbled in writing code as a kid (in BASIC on my Commodore 64) and as a college student (FORTRAN in engineering applications), but object oriented programming was a big conceptual leap to make.</p>
<h2>What were some of the biggest obstacles you found outside the actual learning?</h2>
<blockquote><p><em>The biggest obstacle by far was learning how to be a good co-worker, and how to effectively communicate.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I nearly wasn't promoted to QA because I wasn't tactful when talking to the developers; receiving that feedback early on enabled me to be mindful of not only my work, but my relationships with fellow co-workers. Later on, when I was promoted from QA manager to full time developer, the same QA engineers I had been managing became the guys who were now testing the code I was writing. It was a bumpy road transitioning those relationships, and it took a lot of clear, facilitated communication to make it happen.</p>
<h2>Is your life different now, emotionally speaking?</h2>
<p>Without question. Up until I began writing code, I had poured my creative, problem-solving energies into competitive hobbies and games.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Pouring that energy into my career has been deeply satisfying in a way that playing games never was.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I have a confidence and trust in myself that comes from facing and overcoming challenge after challenge. At the same time, I'm more humble and a more receptive listener than I was when I began. The more you learn, you more you understand about how little you know.</p>
<h2>What's next for you?</h2>
<p>To start with, a long vacation. I'm currently planning to take a break and go travelling starting in August of this year. I have quite a long list of places I'd like to visit, and an ambition to vacation long enough that I'm eager to work again by the end of it. Eventually I would like to build something from scratch again; I loved the experience and would love to repeat it with all the learnings I have from the first time around. I want to build a product that improves people's lives, and am particularly interested in education, neuroscience and spirituality.</p>
<h2>Any closing thoughts for those thinking about learning to program?</h2>
<p>For me, there are a number of key factors in the learning process which are worth minding.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>First of all, there is no substitute for hours of practice.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>An hour spent writing code is worth 10 hours reading about code. But hours of practice can be daunting if the practice isn't fun. So it's important to follow your interest while practicing; as an example, an early exercise I designed for myself was around the game Set, which I was really into at the time.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Play is also important- there's a lot to be learned simply tinkering with something, without an end goal.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, it's important to manage your level of challenge; too little challenge and practice becomes boring, and too much challenge becomes frustrating.</p>
<p>Of course, hours of practice in a vacuum suffer from a lack of outside input and reflection.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Just a little bit of mentorship at the right time can make all the difference.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Through this <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/learning%20programming/2012/11/30/learning-programming/">Pathways to Programming</a> interview series, we talk to formerly non-technical people about how they learned to program in a non-traditional way and what they’re doing now. If you’ve taken your own unconventional path to becoming a programmer, we’d love to hear about it. Send a short email to <a href="mailto:scott.james@devbootcamp.com">scott.james@devbootcamp.com</a> and let’s talk.</em></strong></p>
