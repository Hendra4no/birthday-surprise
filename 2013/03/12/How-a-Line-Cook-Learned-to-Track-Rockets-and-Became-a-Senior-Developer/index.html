You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<p><strong><em>"The BEST way to get into programming is to hang out with great programmers and just do it."</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>-- Andrew Kelleher</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.com/imgs/blog/manhattan-bridge.jpg" alt="Dev Bootcamp Manhattan Andrew Kelleher"/></p>
<p>Today we hear from Andrew Kelleher, a Senior Developer at <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">Buzzfeed</a> where he works with ads and data.</p>
<p>Kelleher spent years as a line cook before moving to New York and teaching himself to code as a labor union analyst. Most recently he built a dating app as part of a startup before they were acquired. Read on to hear about tracking a rocket with a homing beacon, why he reads linguistics and graph theory in his free time, and how he feels about architecture and unit testing.</p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.com/imgs/blog/Kelleher-Andrew-3.jpg" alt="Devbootcamp Andrew Kelleher"/></p>
<h2>Who are you? Tell us about yourself.</h2>
<p>My name is Andrew Kelleher. I'm a Senior Developer at <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">Buzzfeed</a> in Manhattan now working with the ads team as well as the data team. I grew up in Charleston, SC, one of triplets in a house of 6 kids. My mom is a nurse, and my step-dad did construction. I went to a quasi-state college for physics and math, Clemson University. I graduated with a B.S. in 2007.</p>
<h2>What were you doing before? What made you decide to code?</h2>
<p>Before coding I was a line cook. I did that for about 10 years. My first job was in a little pizza restaurant when I was 14 or so, washing dishes and prepping food. When I moved to New York it was after my last cooking job. I took classes at CUNY for labor studies and got a job as an analyst for a labor union. I started coding out of necessity for work. The data infrastructure was lacking so I started reading and building it out.</p>
<h2>How did you learn? What were the resources that were most valuable? What surprised you about learning?</h2>
<p>I first started learning to code when I was around 14 or 15. I just played with HTML and what little JavaScript existed at the time. As time went on I got more into math and science and my good friend, Luca, coached me through some Python as he was learning it himself. He helped me a lot with my senior thesis: tracking a rocket with a homing beacon through auroral plasma moving mach 5 and spinning.</p>
<p>At the union I started along the web front a little more. I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Teach-Yourself-MySQL-Apache-Edition/dp/0672335433/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362713207&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=apache%2C+php%2C+and+mysql">Sams Teach Yourself PHP, MySQL and Apache All in One</a> and read it cover to cover in a week. I had a basic application working in another two.</p>
<p>Besides that <a href="http://w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> were pretty clutch. If you REALLY want to learn a language, though, there's no skating around getting into the official documentation at some point.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What surprised me is how similar different languages are...</em></p></blockquote>
<p>There are some very central concepts like reference vs. value, how inheritance works, private vs. public methods, etc, but when you nail down the differences between the languages it's very fast to pick up a new one.</p>
<h2>What have you been doing with it?</h2>
<p>I just did a stint at a startup that primarily used Ruby on Rails. Our first application was a dating app called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/technology/in-online-dating-taking-a-chance-on-love-and-algorithms.html">Yoke</a>, written entirely in ROR. It makes it very fast to get a webapp up and running. Just before the startup was acquired by Buzzfeed we were doing more computationally intensive stuff and were using Python with numpy and scipy.</p>
<p>In my free time I like to read linguistics books and graph theory. It's fun to see what's out there already implemented. I'd love to write a linguistics package of my own some day.</p>
<h2>What were some mistakes you made or challenges you faced?</h2>
<p>Not getting into architecture and unit testing soon enough. A well architected app makes it soo easy to remember file paths. It also makes it easy to say "this code belongs here" or "this code doesn't belong here." When you get around 40K lines you start forgetting where what is. By using a well-established architecture you don't have that problem and you can focus more on the logic of your application.</p>
<p>As far as unit testing...it's kind of a chicken-or-the-egg thing. To really see the importance of unit tests you have to work on a large application that uses them and one that doesn't. When you introduce your first big bug into that application with 80 or 90% test coverage you realize. "Wow. This would have taken all day to debug without these tests."</p>
<h2>What were some of the biggest obstacles you found outside the actual learning?</h2>
<blockquote><p><em>Outside the actual learning communication can be tricky.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It's very important to speak precisely. When you're designing or building an application with a whole lot of different foos running around, you have to speak so your co-workers know exactly which foo you're talking about. Similarly it can be tough to realize when you're not on the same page as a coworker, when they're talking about 'bar' over there and you're thinking about 'bar' somewhere else. If someone's using pronouns instead of proper nouns or function names it's often best to say, "Hang on – you're talking about 'baz' and not 'foobar', right?".</p>
<h2>How do you find your life different now emotionally speaking?</h2>
<p>I started learning to code a long time ago. I've grown a lot as a person in the last decade, and I suppose I can attribute some amount of that to always being able to code when I feel bored or curious. It's rewarding and enriching.</p>
<h2>What’s next for you?</h2>
<p>I really like where I'm at right now. Buzzfeed is a fantastic company and I'm glad to be part of an amazing team.</p>
<h2>Any closing thoughts for those thinking about learning to program?</h2>
<p>I'd love to give a shout out to Spencer for his love of architecture and "no one right answer," and Jeff for his ability ground and curb over-architecting and the whole team over here for always having something new to teach and for their readiness to learn.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The BEST way to get into programming is to hang out with great programmers and just do it.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>You can read a lot about architectures and design patterns, but until you implement them yourself or see a really boss implementation they aren't yours yet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Through this <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/learning%20programming/2012/11/30/learning-programming/">Pathways to Programming</a> interview series, we talk to formerly non-technical people about how they learned to program in a non-traditional way and what they’re doing now. If you’ve taken your own unconventional path to becoming a programmer, we’d love to hear about it. Send a short email to <a href="mailto:scott.james@devbootcamp.com">scott.james@devbootcamp.com</a> and let’s talk.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Thanks to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thousandrobots/5907213207/sizes/l/in/photostream/">adm</a> for the amazing, unretouched photo of Manhattan.</em></p>
