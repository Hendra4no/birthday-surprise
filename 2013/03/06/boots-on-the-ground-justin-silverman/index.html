You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<h2><em>"That grabbed me and I thought, I have to be a part of that."</em></h2>
<h3><em>-- Justin Silverman</em></h3>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/dbc-interior.png" alt="Justin Silverman Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<p>Dev Bootcamp students share a common love for coding, but how each individual student came to that love is always a unique story. In our <em>Boots on the Ground</em> series we invite the "boots" who are currently at Dev Bootcamp to share some of their personal story.</p>
<p>Today we hear from Justin Silverman, who is making the transition to coding from private equity investment. He talks about reigniting a latent love for coding, how a hobby can turn into a career path, and what made him think, "if I like it this much, I can't ignore that."</p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/justin-silverman.jpg" alt="Justin Silverman Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<h2>Quick Facts</h2>
<p><strong>Age: 31</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hometown: San Francisco, California</strong></p>
<p><strong>Most recent work: Private Equity Investment Professional</strong></p>
<h2>Why did you choose Dev Bootcamp?</h2>
<p>I looked at Dev Bootcamp and thought, here's a structured program to help you develop the skills you need to become a developer and a recruiting program to help you find a job. And they've had a lot of students already go through and prove that the program works if you put what you need to into it.</p>
<p>Also, I read a blog of a student from a previous cohort who provided a pretty detailed day by day account. Everything from people coming from all different backgrounds to the emphasis on learning to code, but also about the other soft skills, group yoga, and offering a full immersion environment.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>That grabbed me and I thought, I have to be a part of that.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>How is your transition going?</h2>
<p>My wife and I were in New York for 3 years while she went to graduate school, and we were at the point where we wanted to figure out how to make a move back to the Bay Area happen rather than just waiting for an ideal scenario. She just got a new job here in San Francisco right around the time I was accepted.</p>
<p>Also, I grew up in the Bay Area and I knew I wanted to come back. The fact that that most companies coming to hiring day will be local was important to me, I didn't want to do a program in a different city and then try to get recruited in San Francisco.</p>
<h2>Were you coding before you got here?</h2>
<p>I wrote the code for a Rails app to test an idea around professional networking in New York. It's like Match.com for professional networking and we set you up on a networking lunch nearby your office. Basically you tell us what you're interested in and we do the rest. I don't know if I could call it a beta version, but it's launched and people have been meeting for lunches the last few months. I spent most of the last 3 months between quitting my last job and starting Dev Bootcamp working on that. I knew enough to figure out how to do the parts that I didn't know how to do. And now it's out there.</p>
<p>My early experience was a couple of CS classes I took as an undergrad. I really enjoyed the classes I took, but I don't think I had the right combination of maturity and effort necessary to excel. Things kicked off again for me when Codecademy started their Code Year in 2012. Then I took a class through Skillshare and couldn't get enough. I spent my free time and even some time I was supposed to be doing stuff for my prior job working on projects for the Skillshare class.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I thought, if I like it this much, I can't ignore that. So I thought, how can I turn this into a career and not let it be a hobby or something on the side that gets put on the back burner when things get busy?</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>What do you do when you're not coding?</h2>
<p>I played football in college for two years before blowing out both of my knees, and I still try to stay active going to the gym, hiking, or riding my bike around the city.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years I also developed an enjoyment for cooking. I realized it wasn't going to work for my wife and I if she just cooked everything.</p>
<p>Understanding our food system and being in touch with where our food comes from is important to me so I started learning how to cook a few basic things up from her. I experimented with other ways to learn, and for the last 3 months I've cooked every dinner at home for the both of us, which is just a total reversal of how things were.</p>
<p>I wrote about tinkering with my process for making perfect soft-boiled eggs (a household favorite) as part of my Dev Bootcamp application. I was little nervous that wasnâ€™t the type of tinkering they were looking for, but apparently that worked out ok.</p>
<h2>What's your sense for Dev Bootcamp now that you're here?</h2>
<p>After 3 days now the overwhelming feeling I've gotten from the program, which is awesome, is that it couldn't be any more clear how much everybody on staff actually cares about our learning.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Everyone's either so in tune with what's going on or they're constantly trying to figure out how to get more in tune. It's such a unique environment.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em>This post is a part of the "Boots On The Ground" series which tells the stories of Dev Bootcamp students - where they came from, where they're going, and what excites them about the journey.
