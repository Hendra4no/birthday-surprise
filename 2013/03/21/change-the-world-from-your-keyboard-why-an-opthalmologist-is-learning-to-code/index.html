You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<h2><em>"After going to more than 10 years of formal education (med school, medical specialty, business school), this is by far my best learning experience."</em></h2>
<h2><em>-- Omar Rayward</em></h2>

<p>Dev Bootcamp students share a common love fr coding, but how each individual student came to that love is always a unique story. In our <em>Boots on the Ground</em> series we invite the "boots" who are currently at Dev Bootcamp to share some of their personal story.</p>
<p>Today we hear from Omar Rayward, who is making the transition to coding after completing his training as an opthalmologist as part of his mission to help create a new health care system. He talks about why he is changing careers, what it's like to be at DBC while his family is still in Spain, and why he's excited about the DBC model of education.</p>

<h2>Quick Facts</h2>
<p><strong>Age: 31</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hometown: Madrid, Spain</strong></p>
<p><strong>Most Recent Work: Ophthalmology resident at Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain</strong></p>
<hr/>
<hr/>
<h2>Why are you changing careers?</h2>
<p>I honestly feel that the health care industry is broken in many ways.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We are living in the 21st Century, and we haven’t figured out how to create a health care system accessible to everyone at a reasonable cost.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>While I was finishing my training as an Ophthalmologist in Madrid, Spain, it became clear to me that the actual system is not sustainable for much longer.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there are two drivers that, if not reverted, are going to continue increasing health care costs.</p>
<p>The Health Care system is built in a model in which “the more the doctor does, the more he/she bills," without taking into account the outcome of the patient.</p>
<p>Also, due to the expenses derived from expensive law suites, doctors tend to practice what is called “defensive medicine." This basically means to run extra diagnostic-tests to avoid possible lawsuits.</p>
<p>I feel that the only way in which we are going to be able to change the system and have a sustainable health care system is through technology. Ultimately that’s my reason to change from medicine to coding.</p>
<h2>Why did you choose Dev Bootcamp?</h2>
<p>The first time that I heard about Dev Boot Camp was in April of last year. At that time, this was the only program 9-week immersion ruby on rails course with incredible, high employability rate.</p>
<p>Around that time I was thinking about moving to Silicon Valley for a career change, and I didn’t want to go for another 4-year period of formal education, so it seemed like the perfect fit for me.</p>
<p>After talking to my wife about the decision I decided to give it a shot, and luckily here I am.</p>
<h2>How is your transition going?</h2>
<blockquote><p><em>It has been 8 weeks since I started the program, and it may sound like a cliché, but it seems like I have been here for 6 months.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I am putting 14+ hours a day of coding, like everyone else, and the only thing that makes the transition possible is the fact that I am constantly surrounded with students with the same passion for learning that I have. Also, the fact that I’m not from San Francisco and I have very few friends in the area, helps to be completely focused on the course.</p>
<p>Probably the toughest part of the transition is that while I’m completing this course, my daughter and child are still in Madrid.</p>
<h2>Were you coding before you got here?</h2>
<p>I started coding 4-5 months before coming to DBC. The first programming language that I studied was Python. I started studying on my own through some Udacity courses. And actually the first time that I started learning Ruby was with the pre-course prep material that was sent from DBC 7 weeks before starting the course.</p>
<p>Other than that I didn’t have any prior programming experience or any other kind of formal education in Computer Science.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>For future boots, study and prep as much as possible before coming to DBC, because the more you prepare yourself, the more you will learn at DBC.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I am glad that I studied a couple of months in advance before coming to DBC, if not it would have been much harder.</p>
<h2>What do you do when you’re not coding?</h2>
<p>I sleep.</p>
<p>Seriously, I had my first child around 9 months ago. So I try to spend as much time as possible with my family enjoying my daughter’s everyday progress.</p>
<p>I also have an entrepreneurial soul, so I spend a lot of time reading and researching about start-ups that are trying to improve health care through technology.</p>
<h2>What’s your sense for Dev Bootcamp now that you’re here?</h2>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Before I came to DBC, I read every single post of the two prior cohorts, so I thought that I had a clear picture of what this was about. I wasn’t even close. I am enjoying every single moment of this experience. At times, it can be tough, but it is definitely worth it.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>After going to more than 10 years of formal education (med school, medical specialty, business school), this is by far my best learning experience.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The reason being is that we have a very clear goal of what we want to achieve in this 9-week period, and every one of us is determined to succeed.</p>
<p>Now that, I’ve been around for almost 2 months, I truly believe that the educational model that DBC has created is going to play a major role in the future of higher education. I am very excited to see which is going to be the next field in education that embraces this model.</p>
<h2>What got you interested in coding?</h2>
<p>Being a doctor, I understood that, in the best of cases, I could only help one patient at a time. There are only a certain number of hours in a day, so at the end of the day, the amount of patients that I could help was very limited.</p>
<p>Coding is a completely different story. The most exciting thing about coding is that by coding one has the opportunity to change the world from your keyboard.</p>
<p>That’s what got me interested in coding, so I tried it, and I loved it.</p>
