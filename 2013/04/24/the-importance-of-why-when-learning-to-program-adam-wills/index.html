You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<p><strong><em>"You have to realize that you can't know everything about everything, and be okay with that."</em></strong></p>
<p>-- Adam Wills</p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.com/imgs/blog/ontario.jpg" alt="Dev Bootcamp Adam Wills"/></p>
<p>Today we hear from <a href="http://adamwills.com">Adam Wills</a>, a web developer and concert photographer living in southern Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>Willis is a lifelong learner who works as a web applications developer for his local municipality and loves the fact that he gets paid to do what used to be a hobby for him. He talks with us about the importance of Google ninja search skills, why the most important thing about learning to program is to understand WHY you are doing something, and why learning to code changes your life both in and out of the office.</p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.com/imgs/blog/adam-wills.jpg" alt="Dev Bootcamp Adam Wills"/></p>
<h2>Who are you? Tell us about yourself.</h2>
<p>My name is Adam Wills, and I'm a web developer from a small town in southern Ontario, Canada. My background is in PHP, but as of late, I have been entering the world of ASP.net for my day job (I know, I know, but we run a Microsoft based infrastructure so it makes sense). I also do some freelancing on top of the day job, putting together websites for local small businesses.</p>
<p>My second love is photography - primarily concert photography. I've only been shooting for about 4 years now but have accomplished so much in terms of personal goals. It's been a very satisfying hobby.</p>
<h2>What were you doing before? What made you decide to code?</h2>
<p>I used to work as logistics coordinator for a local transportation company. It was a good opportunity at the time, but I knew it wasn't my calling. I just didn't have that satisfaction of really enjoying what I was doing. I knew I wanted to get into working on the web, so when a local opening became available - even if it was part time and a temporary contract - I jumped at the opportunity.</p>
<h2>How did you learn? What were the resources that were most valuable? What surprised you about learning?</h2>
<p>I started learning HTML way back (the late '90s perhaps?), simply by absorbing as many online resources as I could. I remember that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970529013015/http://htmlgoodies.com/">HTML Goodies</a>was a great resource at the time.</p>
<p>From there I went into PHP and picked that up from a great book I had. I've picked up bits on all kinds of different subjects from all kinds of sources - online tutorials, articles, conferences, viewing source code.</p>
<p>Once I finished high school, I went to college for a 2-year web development course, which basically became a formality. As I had done a lot of independent learning before this, I found that my course didn't catch up to my skills until the end of the course. But, at least I had that piece of paper that most employers look for.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The most valuable resource, however, is a solid set of search skills. Becoming a Google ninja helps so much, especially when you're switching between programming languages frequently and some of the subtleties of the languages seem to blur together.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I wouldn't say it is surprising, but the most mind-blowing thing about learning is the amount of knowledge that is out there. You could easily spend the equivalent of a full time job just learning about the growing number of web technologies. There's always going to be something new to learn, some new technique out there, or some new technology to take advantage of.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You have to realize that you can't know everything about everything, and be okay with that.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Concentrate on a couple areas at first - get comfortable with them - and expand from there.</p>
<h2>What have you been doing with it?</h2>
<p>I've been working for my local municipality for the last 3 years developing and maintaining internal and external web applications. I've also taken on the role of our local web accessibility expert, trying to guide us to a more accessible online presence.</p>
<p>I've also been freelancing for some local businesses. Eventually I'd like to have some time for some personal projects, but they always seem to get put on the back-burner.</p>
<h2>What were some mistakes you made or challenges you faced while learning?</h2>
<p>I'm not sure that I would classify anything that I've done en route as "mistakes" - but more as "learning experiences."</p>
<p>Are there things that I could have done better? Quicker? More efficiently? Absolutely. But experiencing this only helped me know how I learn best and things that don't work as well. You can read all kinds of ways to learn more effectively - and sure, you can incorporate them - but everyone learns differently.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>My biggest piece of advice is always to really understand what it is that you're doing. Whenever you make a decision, explain to yourself WHY it is that you're choosing solution A instead of solution B. If you're ever doing something "just because" - you need a better understanding of the problem in question.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>What were some of the biggest obstacles you found outside the actual learning?</h2>
<p>Finding time for personal projects. Once you're done with school and start working, it's difficult to make time to sit down and work on something. I have a list of projects and things I'd like to learn, but once I'm done a day at work, some daily errands, and work on some freelancing stuff, the last thing I want to do is start a new project based on a new language that I'm not comfortable with yet.</p>
<h2>How do you find your life different now, emotionally speaking?</h2>
<p><em>I love what I do. I get paid for what I used to do as a hobby. You can't get any better than that.</em></p>
<p>When I wake up in the morning, I don't have that dread of going into the office for a job that I don't get any personal satisfaction from. Instead, I get excited about getting close to finishing a project that I've been working on for weeks.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The change in attitude reflects not only in your performance at work, but also your attitudes outside of it.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>What’s next for you?</h2>
<p>The plan is to put my freelancing career on hold for a while and focus on checking off some of those "things to learn" items (Drupal, Ruby on Rails), and start doing a few projects for myself. Even if nothing pans out, learning new things is always fun.</p>
<h2>Any closing thoughts for those thinking about learning to program?</h2>
<p>Dive in. Find out what is the best method for you to learn (whether it's a book, screencasts, step-by-step tutorials), find some good sources that fit your needs and absorb.</p>
<p>Subscribe to blogs. Follow influential people on Twitter. Join online forums. Listen to podcasts.</p>
<p>Put your new knowledge into practice. Come up with a small project that interests you (that part is important), and build it using what you've just learned. Start small, then slowly add items to your toolbox.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>As you learn, you'll laugh at code you've written a couple weeks ago - but that's okay. We've all gone through it. Rewrite it. Get more efficient. And never stop learning.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Through this <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/learning%20programming/2012/11/30/learning-programming/">Pathways to Programming</a> interview series, we talk to formerly non-technical people about how they learned to program in a non-traditional way and what they’re doing now. If you’ve taken your own unconventional path to becoming a programmer, we’d love to hear about it. Send a short email to <a href="mailto:scott.james@devbootcamp.com">scott.james@devbootcamp.com</a> and let’s talk.</em></strong></p>
