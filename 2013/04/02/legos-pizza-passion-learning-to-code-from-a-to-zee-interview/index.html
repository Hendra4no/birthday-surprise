You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<p><strong><em>"There are few things sweeter than cracking open a beer and some crappy code then refactoring it into something simple and expressive."</em></strong></p>
<p>-- Zee Spencer</p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.com/imgs/blog/dbc-class-pic-zee.jpg" alt="Dev Bootcamp Zee Spencer"/></p>
<p>Today we hear from Zee Spencer, a programming consultant and instructor here at Dev Bootcamp.</p>
<p>Spencer started teaching himself to code as soon as he could sit at a keyboard, reading every book and taking every class he could find. His passion to learn and create led him to start clubs and take unpaid internships throughout school. He has brought that same passion to the product teams he's led, the eCommerce platform he helped re-launch for one of the top pizza-delivery companies, the startups he mentors, and the students he works with at DBC. Today he shares a few stories with us about how he tried to make his first video game at 8 years old, what crippled him early in his career, and what living the ABC means.</p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.com/imgs/blog/zee-spencer.jpg" alt="Dev Bootcamp Zee Spencer"/></p>
<h2>Who are you? Tell us about yourself.</h2>
<p>My name is Zee. I teach here at DBC, help teams learn to deliver meaningful products, and in my free time I cultivate a community of improvement called <a href="http://growingdevelopers.com/">Growing Developers</a>.</p>
<h2>What were you doing before? What made you decide to code?</h2>
<p>Well, <em>before</em> I was programming I was playing with legos. Before that things get fuzzy, but my mother tells me I mostly drooled in a crib and soiled myself.</p>
<h2>How did you learn? What were the resources that were most valuable? What surprised you about learning?</h2>
<p>I learned mostly through error and luck.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to take a class on computers for 1st graders. It taught me how to create files in DOS, work with a spreadsheets, and even play with the innards of an old computer.</p>
<p>My dad worked in IT so we always had computers in the house. I remember trying to make a video game called "Rad Race" by creating files on the file system and describing what I wanted the game to be like. As you can imagine, this did not work. At all.</p>
<p>Sometime in the future, 3rd grade or so, one of my friends showed me a kids technology magazine that had computer code for a game in the back. I knew what it was because I played the old DOS game "Gorrillas.bas" which required me to run it in QBASIC to play. I decided I <em>MUST</em> make this new game work on the computer, so I desperately typed in all the statements I understood.</p>
<p>Basically, it looked like this:</p>
<p>10 PRINT "GIVE ME A COOKIE"</p>
<p>20 GOTO 10</p>
<p>Surprisingly, this didn't work.</p>
<p>Over the next few years I checked out every BASIC book our library had, many several times. Eventually I got to the point where I could <em>actually make something happen</em> and understand what was going on! HOORAY!</p>
<p>This snowballed into starting a programming club in Junior High where we made programs in BASIC on donated Compaq 486's. This is the time I met John and Tom, two fellow-novices with a huge passion for computers and making things. We started hanging out and hacking, playing video games, building computers, and otherwise being giant nerds. We still hang out regularly and talk shop.</p>
<p>In High School I took a class on web design and was offered an unpaid internship chopping up PSDs into HTML/CSS. I jumped at the opportunity, and quickly forced my way into doing "real programming" with PHP on the server side. Eventually, I wrote my own PHP web application framework with a horrible custom implementation of the ActiveRecord pattern which, much to my chagrin, is still in production today.</p>
<h2>What have you been doing with it?</h2>
<p>Making so many things. SO. Many. Things.</p>
<p>I was engineer #2 at a company which now employees 20+ developers, designers, and testers in mid-Michigan; led product teams; helped re-launch the eCommerce platform for one of the top pizza-delivery companies; and mentored product teams from tiny startups to giant insurance companies.</p>
<h2>What were some mistakes you made or challenges you faced while learning?</h2>
<blockquote><p><em>My greatest mistake is allowing my ego to get in the way of my excellence.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I sometimes consider myself too good to learn. This crippled me early in my career; and prevented me from being effective.</p>
<p>10 years ago, I understood ~1% of what I understand now. In 10 years, I hope I get to enjoy another 10,000% increase in my understanding of computing and the world around me.</p>
<h2>What were some of the biggest obstacles you found outside the actual learning?</h2>
<p>I grew up in podunksville, MI; so finding peers and mentors required some effort.</p>
<h2>What’s next for you?</h2>
<p>Coding. Teaching. Pairing. Learning. Mentoring. Living the ABC: Always Be Coding!</p>
<h2>Any closing thoughts for those thinking about learning to program?</h2>
<p>There are few things sweeter than cracking open a beer and some crappy code then refactoring it into something simple and expressive. It's therapy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Through this <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/learning%20programming/2012/11/30/learning-programming/">Pathways to Programming</a> interview series, we talk to formerly non-technical people about how they learned to program in a non-traditional way and what they’re doing now. If you’ve taken your own unconventional path to becoming a programmer, we’d love to hear about it. Send a short email to <a href="mailto:scott.james@devbootcamp.com">scott.james@devbootcamp.com</a> and let’s talk.</em></strong></p>
