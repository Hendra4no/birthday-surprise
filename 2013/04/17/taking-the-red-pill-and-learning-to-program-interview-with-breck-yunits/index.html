You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<p><strong><em>"Learning to program is no different than learning to cook or learning carpentry. It's all about continuous practice over a lot of years."</em></strong></p>
<p><em>-- Breck Yunits</em></p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.com/imgs/blog/red-pill.jpg" alt="Dev Bootcamp INTERVIEWEE name Interview"/></p>
<p>Today we hear from Breck Yunits, a consulting engineer at <a href="http://labzero.com/">Lab Zero</a>, where he works on all manner of web apps for clients.</p>
<p>Yunits says he took the red pill long ago. He had to ignore a lot of people who told him he shouldn't bother learning to program and put in the years of investment and practice to make it happen. For him, programming continues to be <em>"a fascinating subject that doesn't cease to amaze me."</em> He has a <a href="http://breckyunits.com/">great blog</a> where he shares his thoughts on probability, programming, economics and life.</p>
<p>He talks with us about his passion for saving people time with software, why he tells every programmer he meets to invest hundreds of dollars in books every year, and why practice is the secret to being a better programmer.</p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.com/imgs/blog/breck-yunits.jpg" alt="Dev Bootcamp INTERVIEWEE name"/></p>
<h2>Who are you? Tell us about yourself.</h2>
<p>I am a 29 year old programmer living in San Francisco. I like to make software that saves people time. Right now I'm working at a startup, Nudge, that saves "idea people" time turning website ideas into prototypes.</p>
<h2>What were you doing before? What made you decide to code?</h2>
<p>I grew up in Brockton, MA, and created my first HTML page back in 1996 at the age of 12 when my family got a computer and subscribed to a local ISP called iCi.net.</p>
<p>1997 through 2007 were the "dark ages" for my coding career. I used computers a lot, but was completely oblivious to how they actually worked. I made many short lived attempts to learn programming, but could never quite figure it out. Those were frustrating times. People also told me not to learn programming, that it was all going to get offshored.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Luckily I eventually sensed that they were completely wrong, it was the programmers who were creating all the new exciting concepts in the world, and that I should really become one.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>How did you learn? What were the resources that were most valuable? What surprised you about learning?</h2>
<blockquote><p><em>Books have hands down been the most valuable thing for me.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In December 2007, after many failed attempts at learning programming, I took a gamble and plunked down most of my money, $500, on a random assortment of highly rated programming books. That was the best investment of my life. It was slow going, and I read things completely out of order, but it was a big step. The good thing about books is that no matter where you are in the world, you have access to the best advice from some of the best programmers that have ever lived.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>To this day I still learn mostly from books. I tell every programmer I meet that if they aren't spending a few hundred a year on programming books, they are underinvesting.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Even if you are sitting next to Linus Torvalds, you should supplement your study with books. Peers are awesome, the web is awesome, but books contain very refined information about every important topic.</p>
<p>Second to buying those books, learning from peers is critical. Getting my first true full time programming job at Lab Zero was the most valuable thing for me. Being surrounded by folks who could really code, and who were willing to cut me some slack and mentor me, was very important. It's also way more enjoyable and fruitful to work on team projects than to work alone.</p>
<h2>What have you been doing with it?</h2>
<p>So far I've mostly worked as a consulting engineer for various clients, big and small, building web apps. I've also created many small websites to solve problems I have. I've worked on Rails apps, PHP apps, and Node.js apps.</p>
<h2>What were some mistakes you made or challenges you faced while learning?</h2>
<p>I was always in such a rush to learn. I would get so frustrated when I encountered someone who just seemed so much smarter than me. It would discourage me, and make me think I just wasn't smart enough to learn this stuff. I gave up programming a number of times.</p>
<p>As it turns out, it doesn't take any special abilities to become a master at this stuff. It's just time and practice.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Learning to program is no different than learning to cook or learning carpentry. It's all about continuous practice over a lot of years.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>If someone's better than you, it's because they've just had more time to practice. This is the big secret. A lot of programmers don't admit this, they like you to believe that they have some natural giant IQ. If the secret gets out, that anyone can do this if they put in the time, our careers are in trouble. :)</p>
<h2>What were some of the biggest obstacles you found outside the actual learning?</h2>
<p>Finding enough time to practice is the biggest obstacle.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The only way to get enough time is to get a full time job programming.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Then you're guaranteed at least 40 hours per week of practice.</p>
<h2>How do you find your life different now emotionally speaking?</h2>
<p>Programming has become a dream come true. It allows me to create things that save people time, allows me to earn a nice income (when I'm not working for a startup at least).</p>
<p>I'm surprised how philosophically interesting programming becomes. If you love the movie The Matrix, you'll love programming. The more you do it the deeper it gets. Deciding to program is definitely taking the Red Pill. It's a fascinating subject that doesn't cease to amaze me.</p>
<h2>What’s next for you?</h2>
<p>Getting Nudge stable and out into the world!</p>
<h2>Any closing thoughts for those thinking about learning to program?</h2>
<p>I LOVE the idea of Dev Bootcamp. Although the way things have worked out for me in this life have been good, I think of how close I came to never becoming a programmer, which would have been a real shame. I hope DBC helps many folks make it through those hard early stages, and gets them into their first full time programming job, because the payoff is well worth it. This is a fascinating world that will keep you intellectually engaged for life.</p>
<p><strong><em>Through this <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/learning%20programming/2012/11/30/learning-programming/">Pathways to Programming</a> interview series, we talk to formerly non-technical people about how they learned to program in a non-traditional way and what they’re doing now. If you’ve taken your own unconventional path to becoming a programmer, we’d love to hear about it. Send a short email to <a href="mailto:scott.james@devbootcamp.com">scott.james@devbootcamp.com</a> and let’s talk.</em></strong></p>
