You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<h2><em>"Coding will make you a better entrepreneur, banker, hedge fund manager or whatever profession you ultimately choose."</em></h2>
<h2><em>-- Allen Lee</em></h2>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/Boots/dbc-class-panoramic.jpg" alt="Dev Bootcamp Allen Lee"/></p>
<p>Dev Bootcamp students share a common love for coding, but how each individual student came to that love is always a unique story. In our <em>Boots on the Ground</em> series we invite the "boots" who are currently at Dev Bootcamp to share some of their personal story.</p>
<p>Today we hear from Allen Lee, who is learning to code to build out his skill set to become a better entrepreneur. He talks about his love for film and human behavior, the wrenching and rewarding sides to becoming an entrepreneur, and why he thinks learning to code will make him better at whatever he ultimately does for work.</p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/Boots/allen-lee-photo.png" alt="Allen Lee Name Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<h2>Quick Facts</h2>
<p><strong>Age: 38</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hometown: La Mirada, CA</strong></p>
<p><strong>Most recent work: CEO/co-founder of <a href="http://filmquotra.com">filmquotra.com</a>, a web subscription that collects and provides real-time financial information for filmmakers.</strong></p>
<hr/>
<h2>Tell us about you. How do you describe yourself?</h2>
<p>My three greatest passions are film, data and human behavior.</p>
<p>I've spent half my career as an investment banker and hedge fund professional looking at entertainment companies and making investments based on past performance data and management team personalities. I've spent the other half as a corporate executive at entertainment companies such as Lions Gate Entertainment trying to best position the company in the capital markets using past performance data--while working with strong personalities.</p>
<p>I got a MBA from Columbia Business School where I focused on value investing and media economics--again, more data and more human behavior! My lifelong pursuit is to use data to improve the production and consumption of creative content such as film. I've started our company, <a href="http://beta.filmquotra.com">filmquotra</a>, based on that mission.</p>
<h2>Why are you switching careers and why did you choose Dev Bootcamp?</h2>
<p>I don't think I'm switching careers at all, but adding a very important component to my skill set. At filmquotra, I found myself in the de facto role of product development, and I needed to learn more to make better wireframes, design a better product, and most importantly, connect and communicate better with my technical co-founders.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Coding will make you a better entrepreneur, banker, hedge fund manager or whatever profession you ultimately choose. I'm betting that the next paradigm in every career will involve some direct work with computer languages.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I choose DBC because, if I was going to bypass the traditional educational model, the only effective alternative for me would be an immersive one. There is something incomparable to setting aside your entire life and moving to another city to learn a skill 24/7. That commitment alone self-selects the most passionate and most driven individuals. To me, that selection process is the heart of DBC.</p>
<h2>How is your transition going?</h2>
<blockquote><p><em>Transitioning to entrepreneurship has been wrenching. It's like taking a hammer to your life and breaking it down to its raw material so that you can build it back up.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>DBC is just one stage of a years-long process that started in 2009, when I decided finally to pursue my dream of starting my own company. Since then I've moved from a beachfront condo to a bedroom in my mom's house and begged, borrowed and stolen from family members and friends to fund my company.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>But I finally couldn't accept a life, however comfortable or lavish, where I wasn't pursuing my passion. I've found a lot of like-minded individuals at DBC.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Were you coding before you got here?</h2>
<p>No. I was playing around with HTML and CSS while designing filmquotra's prototype. I spent about 3-4 months taking Codecademy courses and finishing the Hartl tutorial before I decided it was taking way too long to be practical. That's when I saw the video for DBC and applied immediately.</p>
<h2>What do you do when youâ€™re not coding?</h2>
<p>I'll watch any film. Really. From the lowest-budget indies to mega-blockbusters. I also love reading Russian literature, surfing and Brazilian jiu-jitsu.</p>
<h2>How is your experience at Dev Bootcamp going?</h2>
<p>Extremely challenging and fulfilling. I had to repeat Phase 1, which was the most humbling but ultimately most rewarding experience so far. The funnest thing I've done in a long time. Bonding with the most motivated, quirkiest collection of characters ever.</p>
<h2>Any closing thoughts for someone considering applying?</h2>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are two types of students at DBC. Those with real coding experience, and those without. If, like me, you fall in the latter category, then you need to prep more and work harder than everyone else. You should expect to be in the bottom half of the class consistently. You will have to speak up to be heard and to be counted. You will have a more volatile and emotional journey. When other boots are socializing during off-hours, going out for lunch or hitting the gym,you will be at your station coding. But, you can do it.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And I believe you will experience the greatest transformation and get the most value out of DBC.</em></p></blockquote>
