<h2><strong><em>"Surround yourself with people who are going to challenge and stretch you, but also won't make you feel bad for asking questions."</em></strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>-- Malcolm Newsome</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/chicago-skyline.jpg" alt="Chicago Skyline"/></p>
<p>This week we talk to Malcolm Newsome, Software Developer at <a href="http://platinumdesignanddevelopment.com/home.aspx">Platinum Design and Development</a> and Co-Founder of <a href="http://sharedstory.org/">SharedStory</a>.</p>
<p>Newsome fell in love with computers at a young age, even writing a letter to Bill Gates and getting invited to be a Microsoft gaming beta tester in the '90s. But before learning to code he followed his heart, studying psychology in college, and then wandered off to follow financial responsibility, working for years in banking.</p>
<p>When he lost his business banking sales job, he had time to think about what mattered to him most: technology and helping people. That's where his coding journey began. His path has included starting several businesses on the way to now working full time as a software developer.</p>

<h2>Who are you? Tell us about your background.</h2>
<p>I'm 32 years old, born and raised in Waukegan, IL, a suburb of Chicago. I grew up as computers were really starting to become commonplace. From a young age I realized I wanted to be a computer programmer. At the school I went to we had a couple of those really old Macs, and one of them would always break down. Somehow I became the one to always fix it. I developed a love for computers at that age, before PC's became the household item that they are.</p>
<p>Another one of my passions has always been helping people, and a large part of my childhood was spent helping people in one way or another. I was somebody people came to for advice, or tutoring and the like. And that laid the foundation for what I've done since.</p>
<p>I was also very heavily involved in sports, mostly basketball. One of my other childhood dreams was to do the whole NBA thing. I also developed a love for music and taught myself how to play the drums.</p>
<p>When it came time to make the big decision of what I was going to focus on in college, I decided to pursue a psychology and sociology degree. I figured, at some point, whether I go to the NBA or not, I'm going to end up helping people, being a mentor, a therapist, or something in the realm where I was giving people advice.</p>
<h2>What were you doing before and what made you decide to code?</h2>
<p>I went to Northern Illinois University where I double-majored in psychology and sociology. When I finished, the reality hit of what working in social services means if you don't have a Masters. I received two job offers in that field, and both were for under $20,000 per year. So I figured, ok, let me see what else is out there.</p>
<p>I decided to go into banking instead with Bank One, now Chase, because they had a management training program, which I liked because it was about helping people and developing relationships. I left banking in 2008, just before the big financial crisis. I just really didn't like banking anymore. It was all about the credit card account, sales numbers and all that, not about the relationships.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>So I went through this period of wondering, "What am I going to do with my life?" and needing to rediscover what I loved and what I was passionate about.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>That led me to start a business called <a href="http://www.etwservices.com/">ETW Services</a>. ETW stands for "Encouraging the World." I was reinvigorated by the desire to help people. I worked with small businesses to help make the environment a better workplace. One of the first contracts I got was with the Waukegan School District. I worked with “at-risk” students at their alternative high school. While doing that, I was able to fulfill the goal of helping young people in a very interesting way. I developed a Life Skills curriculum for them that morphed into a program called the Rising Entrepreneurs Program. Essentially we taught students about the workplace from a business owner's or a manager's perspective.</p>
<p>Alongside ETW Services I started a website called <a href="http://www.gogogreendeals.com/">GoGreenDeals.com</a>. I literally launched it a month before Groupon launched. It was going alright and getting traffic, but I was doing it on my own and it never really grew into the vision of what I had for it.</p>
<p>What I found was that I was spending a lot of time learning how to hack into the CSS and HTML to do updates or get the look and feel that I wanted. I was spending all this time, all these nights learning this stuff, and I could not take myself away from it.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What I found was that it reignited my old desire to be a computer programmer.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So after a year or so with GoGreenDeals.com, I started to think about what I wanted to do next with this technology stuff. I was having all of these ideas around businesses I wanted to create. That's when I made the decision to teach myself how to program.</p>
<h2>How did you learn? What were the resources that were most valuable? What surprised you about learning?</h2>
<p>I went to the library. The first book I got was called <em>Teach Yourself C++ in 21 Days</em> or something like that, so I thought, "Ok, I'm going to do it!"</p>
<p>It was going ok, but I found that I wasn't fully understanding everything that was happening. So I did the research and learned about this language called Python for building things. I found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Python-Programming-Introduction-Computer-Science/dp/1887902996">Python Programming: Introduction to Computer Science</a>, by John Zelle.</p>
<p>I started getting into that book and it was amazing because things were just clicking. Python was great because the syntax is so straightforward and minimal.  So I spent a lot of time in that book. From there, there were plenty of resources on the web. That's how I got started, with sheer desire, and going to what I often refer to my students as "one of the richest places on earth," the library. Lots of late nights and all that.</p>
<p>The other thing I did was seek out people who could give me feedback about what I could improve on. I found the Chicago Python Users group <a href="http://chipy.org/">ChiPy</a> and  started to link in with them. I endeavored to put myself in situations where I knew my programming knowledge wasn't up to what theirs was, so I knew I was going to learn. I would submit things to them and get feedback on it and accelerated my learning that way.</p>
<h2>What were some of the biggest mistakes you made?</h2>
<p>One thing that became a lot more clear to me was when I was reading Dave Hoover's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382">Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman</a> and he describes the concept of <a href="http://www.stickyminds.com/sitewide.asp?Function=edetail&amp;ObjectType=COL&amp;ObjectId=10039">Emptying the Cup</a>.</p>
<p>Emptying the cup is akin to exposing your ignorance in order to learn more. This was important because one thing I would often do was spend a lot more time than I needed to trying to figure some things out on my own, rather than asking someone for help. For that reason, in some regards, I feel like I could have progressed quicker.</p>
<h2>What were some of the biggest obstacles you found outside the actual learning?</h2>
<p>One of the things that surprised me in the beginning, and still kind of surprises me, is that when I learn something new and read materials, there is typically only one example that accompanies an explanation. And even those examples tend to be math problems rather than real life examples. I figured with the Internet I'd be able to find more real life examples.</p>
<p>One of the first things that gave me trouble was loops. While I could understand the explanations, I had trouble visualizing how I would use them. It wasn't until I started coding more things that I would realize, oh, that's where I would use a for loop.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I felt like I stumbled into understanding a lot of concepts.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>One thing I think about in my goal to help others is the possibility of creating a resource like that.</p>
<h2>How do you find your life different emotionally speaking?</h2>
<p>I certainly am much more confident in pursuing new things. When I used to think about programming, I thought about it as something that pretty much only geniuses could do, or at least that you had to be really smart to get really good at it. So confidence came to me through the successes I had along the way as I learned. All of that factors into starting other things that are new as a way to remind myself, "yeah, I can do this."</p>
<p>The other thing that comes to mind from the perspective of my background in psychology and sociology is about one of the first experiences I had as being part of a development team. The <a href="http://chipy.org/">ChiPy</a> group was doing a mentoring project using their own site as sort of an open source project. At that point I had been developing for only about 2 or 3 months, so I didn't know much at all.</p>
<p>One of the things I learned was about how Python uses PIP as a package installer for any dependencies your project needs. Project dependencies are put in a requirements file, so you simply run a command to install all of the packages at once from the file. Not knowing this, I began searching for and trying to install them one by one.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>So the person heading up the project came to me and explained that everything this project needs is right here in this requirements file. And I realized, how similar is that to life, where oftentimes everything we need is already within us, but we go looking elsewhere for the solutions.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Where are you headed?</h2>
<p>I made the decision when I started ETW Services that whatever I was going to be doing from that point on, that I was going to be making an impact on the world. I met some other entrepreneurial guys and we had the idea that we could build something that allowed people to encourage, inspire, and motivate each other through telling their stories. And from that, we built <a href="http://sharedstory.org/">Shared Story</a>. It's a platform to connect people by telling their stories from tribulation to triumph in any area. We believe that everyone has a story to tell and that we need to hear it.</p>
<p>I currently work at <a href="http://platinumdesignanddevelopment.com/home.aspx">Platinum Design and Development</a>. We’re a small, but growing consultancy that does custom software, web and mobile apps. They don’t use much Python there, so I’ve been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to learn C#, Java, Android, JavaScript and true SQL code. I'm learning a ton, and mostly in languages I had no familiarity with previously. </p>
<p>I'm also learning the full cycle development process. We use a 3D process, which is Discovery, Design, and Develop. So I'm learning what’s involved with taking a project from inception to client delivery.</p>
<h2>Any closing thoughts for people thinking about learning to program?</h2>
<p>One of the biggest things is put yourself into situations where you feel like you feel like your level of learning might be inadequate.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Surround yourself with people that are going to challenge and stretch you, but also won't make you feel bad for asking questions.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>That was critical for me. I would go to those ChiPy meetings in my first month or two and they might as well have been speaking a foreign language. But because I immersed myself in it like that, I was able to learn things that I wouldn't have been able to learn otherwise.</p>
<p>Find a Mentor – My learning was greatly accelerated because of a guy who became a bit of a tech mentor to me. I would tell him things I was working on or wanted to learn to do, and he would give me coding challenges. I didn't always understand upfront why he recommended certain challenges, but when I did it, I would realize, "Oh, wow, I got to learn what I wanted to learn and some other cool things too!" He had a way of structuring the challenges based on what I wanted or needed to learn. Interestingly enough, I also got my first job as a developer because of him.</p>
<p><em>Through this <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/learning%20programming/2012/11/30/learning-programming/">Pathways to Programming</a> interview series, we talk to formerly non-technical people about how they learned to program in a non-traditional way and what they’re doing now. If you’ve taken your own unconventional path to becoming a programmer, we’d love to hear about it. Send a <a href="mailto:scott.james@devbootcamp.com">short email</a> and let’s talk.</em></p>
