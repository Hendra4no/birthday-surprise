You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<p>At the Nov. 21 DBC::NYC launch party in SoHo, Shereef, Dave, Tanner and I stood alongside two representatives of <a href="http://www.levo.com/">Levo League</a> to announce a new strategic partnership between our organizations. We unveiled a partial scholarship program called <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/faq/#levo-scholars">the Levo Scholars program</a>.</p>
<p>Starting immediately, women admitted as Levo Scholars will receive a $2,500 discount on the tuition. These partial scholarships will initially be assigned on a first-come, first-serve basis for the first ten (10) Levo women who pass through Dev Bootcamp’s gender- and race-blind admissions process.</p>
<p>The announcement was covered by dozens of publications, including this good article in <a href="http://upstart.bizjournals.com/news/technology/2013/11/25/levo-league-partners-with-dev-bootcamp.html?page=2">UpStart Business Journal</a>.</p>
<p>Levo League is a highly respected community of professional women, operating in 22 cities throughout the US. We see this as an important step but only our first of many together to move towards our shared goal of gender parity in tech. We are also actively pursuing partnerships with other progressive organizations supporting women in technology with the hope to also sign up another similar Scholars program.</p>
<p>We approached Levo League and some other progressive organizations with this initial partnership idea – offering to bear the full financial burden of the $2,500 scholarship – for various no-brainer reasons: a) because our staff and alumni are already closely involved with these organizations, b) because we share their values, c) because they’re highly effective organizations with large and dynamic memberships we love, and d) because we think DBC’s gender diversity efforts will be much more impactful with them as a close ally and partner.</p>
<p>Putting real money down was very important to us because when it comes to gender diversity there is a lot of talk out there. For that reason, it was very important to us to walk the talk. DBC sells out every one of its student cohorts so a partial scholarship like this one directly hits our bottom line. Hats off to Caroline Ghosn and her team at Levo for walking the talk too. From the minute we sat down with them, they immediately jumped onboard and have been instrumental in making this a reality. We are extremely fortunate to be partnering with such a supportive and innovative organization like Levo.</p>
<p>For Tanner and I, it was very important to make gender diversity the central announcement of our NYC launch. We recognize that institutionalized sexism continues to limit women's success in the technical workforce and often discourages entry. While many of these forces are beyond our control, we believe that the first step is to acknowledge this reality and take some action towards addressing it. Doing nothing will only perpetuate existing inequalities. I like the popular phrase, “if you’re not angry, you’re not paying attention.” We’re “angry” and feel that Dev Bootcamp is in a strategic position to contribute to the larger movement for gender parity in tech.</p>
<p>Internally at DBC diversity is baked into the team’s values so it has manifested itself in the curriculum, pedagogy and various other design decisions, but we’re only now more methodologically formulating a DBC gender diversity plan. In an open-source spirit, I’d like to share some of our initial thinking (initial pull request) and am hoping to get some of your input to inform what, exactly, we end up doing (code review &amp; refactoring). Please note that this is just some preliminary thinking and nothing is fully fleshed out or decided. I hope opening this up will trigger a larger conversation among the amazing DBC community and lead to bigger and better outcomes. I also not-so-secretly hope it will inspire other bootcamps to dial up their diversity efforts along with us:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>External</strong>. Gender parity (50:50 women/men) in our cohort admissions is a difficult but important goal to work towards. With the recent hire of a new VP of Marketing, Brandon Croke, and as we ramp up our marketing efforts from $0 spend to “not zero”, it’s important to us to get word of Dev Bootcamp out to more women via strategic partnerships like this one with Levo League and other types of outreach.</li>
<li><strong>Internal</strong>. Here we deliberately seek to engineer and nurture an educational environment that is respectful of every student’s perspective. In fact beyond just respectful, we want to optimize our culture, curriculum and staff to enable fast-paced, break-through learning for students of all backgrounds, shapes, sizes, socio-economic levels and colors. This is hard, very hard, because you can’t optimize for everybody at the same time. At a minimum, Dev Bootcamp must be a place where all students are welcomed and feel safe. To do this we take active consideration in feedback sessions with each cohort to ensure that we surface and address attributes of our internal culture which may be inadvertently discriminatory towards a given group. Formally holding up the mirror to Dev Bootcamp every three weeks can be hard, but it’s necessary. We also discuss topics like sexism and oppression as part of the curriculum so that students are better equipped to face these difficult topics both internally and in their future workplaces. The best way to drive systemic change is to help people be the change and that starts with self-awareness and more developed empathy skills. Lastly, we are also keenly aware that women are more attracted to environments with other women (students, teachers and staff), so this is a priority for us as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>As Dev Bootcamp continues to expand and as we graduate more people into software engineering careers, we also want to take concrete measures to increase our commitment to gender diversity. With greater impact comes greater responsibility. Gender inequality in tech is what they call a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">‘wicked problem’</a> with very complex root causes, and the solution is therefore equally complex. At DBC, we don’t pretend to have the answers, but that’s no excuse for inaction. We’re always looking to do more and to support existing initiatives. If you have ideas or ways to help us further our gender diversity efforts, please don’t hesitate to reach out (e.g. speaking engagements at women’s groups, female mentors/speakers to DBC students, articles on gender parity, women hackathons, mentoring girl groups that are getting exposed to coding, etc.).</p>
