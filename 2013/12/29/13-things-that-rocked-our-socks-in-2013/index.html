You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<p>With 2013 winding to a close, we reformat our pairing workstations and sweep up the assortment of odds and ends left behind by all of the colorful characters who have graced the halls of DBC this past year.</p>
<p>Before we look ahead to 2014 we wanted to thank our community of students, teachers and employers who helped make this year such a success.</p>
<p>Below is a list of happenings that made us all proud to be a part of the DBC family in 2013.</p>
<h2>1. From Teach for America to Dev Bootcamp to $40k IndieGoGo Campaign</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VPdgtrH.png?1?2310" alt="swot bot"/></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rwarbelow">Rachel Warbelow</a> is a middle school teacher in Las Vegas who came to DBC Chicago this past summer. She started her career with Teach for America, and six years later created the SWOT (scholars working overtime) program to prepare first generation students for college.</p>
<p>After learning to code this past summer, she built a <a href="https://github.com/rwarbelow/the_swot_bot/tree/master">classroom management system</a> to help keep her students informed and engaged on their classroom progress. But she wasn’t done yet. She wanted to expose her students to the art of programming, but the school didn’t have the resources for a computer lab. Like any good innovator, she wouldn’t let these barriers stop her and started teaching them with pencil and paper until fellow DBC Alum, Eric Allen, helped her raise <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/a-computer-lab-for-the-scholars-working-overtime-team--2">$40,000</a> with an indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p>If you haven’t seen the video of this story, take a few minutes and watch it <a href="http://vimeo.com/76302820">here</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Coding Challenge Sends Ryan Gosling App Viral</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xxLZGPc.jpg?1?2852" alt="hey girl.io"/></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/keccers">Katherine Champagne</a>, another DBC Chicago student, was given a coding challenge to manipulate web page elements live with Javascript. She thought it would be fun to play off of the Ryan Gosling Hey Girl meme and ended up building a chrome extension which turns all of the images on a web page into one of many Mr. Gosling portraits.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://heygirl.io/">HeyGirl.io</a> was not only a hit with her classmates, outlets like <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/08/13/hey-girl-chrome-extension/">Mashable</a> and the Times thought it was worth sharing. While the app may not be world changing, Katherine was quoted in mashable saying “I hope that heygirl.io inspires more woman to get into web development - there needs to be more of us, ladies! It’s not all math, it’s not boring - as I hope heygirl.io evidences. I’ve found programming to be an incredible creative outlet.”</p>
<h2>3. DBC Grad Receives 2014 Code for America Fellowship</h2>
<p><a href="http://annamarie.me/">Anna-Marie Panlilio</a>, an accomplished artist-turned-DBC Chicago student, was chosen as one of 600 applicants to win a <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/fellows/2014-fellows/#panlilio">2014 Fellowship at Code for America</a> this year.</p>
<p>Code for America is an innovative program who aims to change how citizens participate in government by designing better services, encouraging low-risk settings for innovation and supporting a competitive marketplace for “civic tech.”</p>
<h2>4. DBC Grad Wins Ideation Nation to Help Get People Outdoors</h2>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/Boots/alyssa-camping.jpg" alt="hipcamp alyssa"/></p>
<p>Speaking of Civic Tech, <a href="https://twitter.com/alyraz">Alyssa Ravassio</a> was tired of the hassle it takes to get accurate information on which campsites she should choose from various websites. So after graduating from Dev Bootcamp, she decided to follow her passion for the outdoors and build <a href="http://www.hipcamp.com/">HipCamp</a> in order to help get more people outdoors.</p>
<p>After launching her new company and the app she won this year's <a href="http://www.govtech.com/local/25-Tech-Ideas-that-Might-Solve-a-Community-Problem-.html">Ideation Nation</a> challenge to help improve local communities which is sponsored by Code for America and Mindmixer. Alyssa is a perfect representation of the passionate, multi-talented students Dev Bootcamp attracts describing coding as a practice for her, just like yoga or surfing.</p>
<h2>5. DBC Grad Wins Best Yahoo! Product Hackathon Award</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/52zmj23.png?1?4328" alt="flickrpedia screenshot"/></p>
<p>While our alumni have gone on to win numerous hackathons, one of our top winners from this year was comprised of three DBC grads, <a href="http://scrapandrun.blogspot.com/search/label/DBC">Colleen McCloskey</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/fabianuribe">Fabián Uribe</a>, and Martino Visentin who built “Flickrpedia.” Flickrpedia is a way to spruce up the “walls of text” on Wikipedia with beautiful images from Flickr. It won Yahoo’s Best Use of a Yahoo! Product award and was featured in the <a href="http://yahoodevelopers.tumblr.com/post/62748207228/yahoo-hack-usa-its-a-wrap">Yahoo blog post</a> summarizing the event.</p>
<h2>6. DBC Chicago Teacher Takes Special Dev Project in Libya</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JxE316K.jpg?1?6085" alt="libya graffiti"/></p>
<p>Of course it’s not only our students who continually amaze us, but our teachers are quite an impressive bunch as well. <a href="https://twitter.com/abi">Abi Noda</a>, recently took a special development project in Libya which he describes in detail on his <a href="http://abinoda.com/rebooting-libya">personal blog</a>. After recovering from a bout of food poisoning in Nicaragua, he received an email from a former colleague asking him to build a voter registration website in Libya.</p>
<p>The project involved him being flown into the country and working with locals in order to create a website in both English and Arabic (one read left to right and the other right to left) so that out-of-country voter registrations could elect the constituents responsible for drafting Libya’s constitution and setting the stage of a general election.</p>
<p>He was inspired by “the potential for positive change - economic, cultural, and political - through arming younger generations with the capacity and mindset to innovate in-country”, and we certainly were inspired by his work and reflection on the project.</p>
<h2>7. Founder Shereef Bishay Drops Knowledge on Bloomberg TV</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/db32Do4.png?1?3917" alt="shereef bishay on bloomberg"/></p>
<p>Back here in America, <a href="https://twitter.com/shereefb">Shereef Bishay</a>, founder of Dev Bootcamp was interviewed on Bloomberg TV on how we can reduce the unemployment rate in America. The December Jobs Report showed a slight improvement in the unemployment rate, but there are still an estimated 150,000 technology jobs unfilled because of the technology skills gap in America.</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/81248305">Watch Shereef explain</a> how programs like Dev Bootcamp can help reduce the skills gap, create jobs, and provide a most efficient alternative than “traditional higher education" or read why the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323884304578328243334068564">The Wall Street Journal</a> says [a Smart Investor Would Skip the MBA].</p>
<h2>8. Dev Bootcamp Chicago Opens its doors and Rocks First Year Employment Numbers</h2>
<p>Speaking of jobs, this past year DBC Chicago opened its doors and graduated over 145 students across 9 cohorts. Their employment results were quite impressive with 85% of their first five cohorts employed, with the average salary in the $70k range.</p>
<p>These new junior developers landed jobs at top companies in Chicago like Groupon, Sprout Social, Instructure, Eight Bit, BrightTag, and NCSA. They also went on to other cities such as San Francisco, Austin, Boulder, Minneapolis and New York.</p>
<p>Hats off to the amazing students, teachers and staff we have in the Windy City!</p>
<p><img src="http://media.cdn.builtinchicago.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/Large/images/dbc_grad_love.jpg" alt="DBC Chicago graduation"/></p>
<h2>9. Dev Bootcamp New York Announced!</h2>
<p>2013 was a tremendous year of growth for our students, our internal team and with our new locations in Chicago and now New York City. We’re thrilled to begin our first NYC cohort in March of 2014 and join the ranks of numerous other innovative companies such as Etsy MongoDB, FourSquare to MakerBot, and Kickstarter.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/tannerwelsh">Tanner</a> writes in his <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/2013/10/30/Announcing-Dev-Bootcamp-New-York-City/">announcement post</a> “There are many, many other reasons that we love being in New York City, too many to list here. The city is vibrant and bursting with potential, full of creative people and innovative ideas about education, technology, and the myriad ways that they intersect.”</p>
<h2>10. First Annual Alumni Holiday Hackathon a Huge Success</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/odlZ5y1.jpg?1?9717" alt="dev bootcamp holiday hackathon"/></p>
<p>With over 400 alumni now in the DBC family, we thought what better way to celebrate the holidays than to have a hackathon? Over 40 alumni came to the San Francisco office on December 14th for a 24-hour hackathon filled with holiday cheers.</p>
<p>Projects ranged from a <a href="https://github.com/brunops/aMazeng">Javascript 3-d game</a> to a <a href="http://bootietracker.herokuapp.com/">map of where DBC students currently are</a> (according to LinkedIn data) all over the country. Perhaps the best part of the hackathon came when one of the judges pulled an alumni off the side and said, “My company is working on a similar problem you are solving with that app. Any interest in a job?”</p>
<p>Thanks for all the alumni who came out and participated as well as a shout-out to <a href="https://twitter.com/ChapmanSnowden">Chapman Snowden</a> who made it all happen.</p>
<h2>11. "Rolling Cohort" Model Launched in January of 2013</h2>
<p>At the end of 2012 Dev Bootcamp theorized there was a better way to educate the same amount of students. In the start of the new year we brought the agile development approach to our curriculum and launched our rolling cohort model which starts student down the three weeks of Phase 1, 2 and 3 every three weeks.</p>
<p>This benefited our students and the program in a few areas:</p>
<p>1.<b> Pace</b> - by starting new phases every three weeks we can maintain an extremely fast paced course while also allowing for a student who might struggle for any number of given reasons the opportunity to repeat a phase (for free).</p>
<p>2.<b> Peer learning</b>- by surrounding students with peers who are slightly above or below their skill level a highly collaborative mentorship culture forms improving the learning of both parties.</p>
<p>3.<b> Agile Curriculum</b>- after each three week phase our students provide feedback which allows us to improve our delivery and also allows us to keep up with new developments in the wonderful world of software.</p>
<h2>12. Phase 0 Added to Improve the Student Onboarding Experience</h2>
<p>One of our other big changes this year was the addition of <b>Phase 0</b>, a 60 day instructor-guided virtual prep that makes sure all our students hit the ground running as soon as they arrive for Phase 1. This also allows our teachers to cover more technical topics at a deeper level during the 9-week immersion program while also introducing students and teachers to one another through challenges and pair-programing sessions.</p>
<h2>13. Dev Bootcamp Adopts Holacracy</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZPb3AWA.png?1?4125" alt="Medium's Holacracy collection"/>
While little has been published about this thus far, in 2013 Dev Bootcamp implemented Holacracy, following other organizational leader such as <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com.au/zappos-adoption-of-holacracy-2013-12">Zappos</a> and <a href="http://firstround.com/article/How-Medium-is-building-a-new-kind-of-company-with-no-managers">Medium</a>. Holacracy is described as "an operating system for an intelligence organization" which allows for any individual within a company the chance to address "tensions" (the difference between how things should be vs. how things are) in an open, non-threatening, and non-hierarchical way</p>
<p>In order to maintain our autonomy and productivity with a growing team we hope to avoid management bottlenecks that often plague traditional organizations.</p>
<h2>What Did We Miss?</h2>
<p>No doubt 2013 will go down as a great year in Dev Bootcamp's young history, but are there any big stories we missed?</p>
<p>Let us know on <a href="https://twitter.com/devbootcamp">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/devbootcamp">Facebook</a> and best of luck to you and your learning in 2014!</p>

<h2>14. Dev Bootcamp Chicago Grads Head to the Whitehouse</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HPhEZL7.png?1?6161" alt="department of labor challenge"/></p>
<p>One story we missed was a final project which recently won the US of Department of Labor <a href="http://fairlabor.challengepost.com/">Fair Labor Data Challenge</a>. The project asked for submissions for an innovative tool that let’s consumers know if a local business is following the law when it comes to paying workers fairly. A team consisting of <a href="http://twitter.com/pri1229">Priya Mathew</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/keccers">Katherine Champagne</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/mbacksmeier">Mark Backsmeier</a> built <a href="http://laborsight.com">Laborsight.com</a> which won first place and will be sending the team to Washington DC to meet with the Federal CTO, US Secretary of Labor and the US Chief Innovation Officer.</p>
