You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<h2><strong><em>"Having a solid path to learning to code and a community to get feedback from would have saved me countless hours of frustration and forum searches."</em></strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>-- John McAlester</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/san-francisco-john-macalester.jpg" alt="John McAlester Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<p>This week we talk to John McAlester, founder of <a href="http://www.pigeonlab.net/">PigeonLab</a>, an ebook distribution platform for independent authors.</p>
<p>McAlester started his career in traditional publishing, transitioning early on into website management. After many late nights and learnings on his way to founding a company in the digital publishing space, he's got plenty of insight on the importance of community to learning, the challenge of finding time to practice coding, and the reward of seeing something you built live and public. He continues to use his hard-won programming skills to build new publishing products for authors.</p>

<h2>Who are you? Tell us about yourself.</h2>
<p>My name is John McAlester. I'm the founder of <a href="http://www.pigeonlab.net/">PigeonLab</a>. My background is in English studies and creative writing at the University of Colorado. After college I came to San Francisco and found myself working in the print publishing industry.</p>
<h2>What were you doing before? What made you decide to code?</h2>
<p>I've been messing around with computers since my Dad brought home an Apple IIC in 1985 but never really studied programming. In 2003 I was working for a book packager, which is like a movie producer for books, and the company's website manager left for another job. I knew a few of the buzz words about websites and a couple of the terms of code and I basically convinced them that I knew what I was doing and they let me take over the management of the company's website. I definitely didn't know what I was doing. It was pretty exciting for me but also really stressful.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I spent a lot of nights trying to dissect the website code, which was built with tables and spacer GIFs.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It was a mess, and I actually crashed the site several times while I was learning. Luckily, I was working really late at night and I always had it fixed by the next morning.</p>
<h2>How did you learn? What were the resources that were most valuable? What surprised you about learning?</h2>
<p>I learned through hours and hours of trial and error. I would make some change in the code, save the file, and then load the page in a browser and see if it worked. I did this over and over until I figured out how everything was connected. It was an inefficient and frustrating way to learn.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The most valuable resources to me were sites that had documentation that was easily understandable or when I found another programmer who had the time to explain something to me.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I think the most surprising thing to me was that once you have groked the concepts behind a language or an application you could apply that to other languages. The second language was WAY easier to learn.</p>
<h2>What have you been doing with it?</h2>
<p>Most recently I used WordPress as a web application platform to build the customer dashboard for my company's site at <a href="http://pigeonlab.net">PigeonLab</a>. I have been working with WordPress for about 7 years and it has grown into a really great CMS. While WordPress is not a true MVC application framework, it has much of the functionality of an application framework that you need to build an app. I decided to leverage that existing functionality to build what I needed.</p>
<p>One of the things I like about working with WordPress is that it allows you to exercise your skills in most of the front end languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript). Because of the extensible nature of the plugin system you can pull in other languages like Ruby too.</p>
<h2>What were some mistakes you made or challenges you faced?</h2>
<p>Oh, I made tons of mistakes.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>One of the things about trying to teach myself is that I have often spent days of frustration trying to get some piece of code to work only to figure out that what I was trying to do was not going to work anyways and having to scrap the whole thing.</em></p>
<p><em>Having a solid path to learning to code and a community to get feedback from would have saved me countless hours of frustration and forum searches.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>One of the biggest challenges was just understanding some of the basics about how clients and servers communicate and how the different pieces of code make up a website. Without a background in computer science I didn't have the concepts down and I couldn't problem solve because I didn't know which questions I should be asking.</p>
<h2>What were some of the biggest obstacles you found outside the actual learning?</h2>
<p>Finding time to practice. There are a lot of demands in life and having hours a day to mess with code and maybe not even get anywhere is tough. Taking some formal classes would have saved me SO much time. It's so much more efficient.</p>
<h2>How do you find your life different now emotionally speaking?</h2>
<p>One pattern that I have started to recognize is that often I will begin to try and tackle some programming problem and as I try and try to solve it I become more and more narrowly focused on what I think is the path to the solution. I will bang away on it for hours sometimes and come up without a solution. However, sometimes I am able to step back and take a break from the problem, or even better, sleep on it.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Invariably, with some distance from the problem, I am able to come back and have a broader view and usually I am able to figure something out pretty quick.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I think you can apply that to life in general. If you are stuck and frustrated in solving some issue in your life, put it down for a while and come back to it. With some distance an answer will often appear. I've tried to apply that to my life and I think it has saved me some frustration.</p>
<h2>What’s next for you?</h2>
<p>One project that I would like to tackle in the not too distant future would be a cloud based writing application probably built with Ruby. I will definitely be taking some kind of classes to build my Ruby chops. I can't handle the long hours and forum searching required to teach myself anymore! As a father and business owner I have to be more efficient with my time.</p>
<h2>Any closing thoughts for those thinking about learning to program?</h2>
<p>Go for it! Programming is not only a must have job skill for the new economy it also helps you learn how to problem solve. There are often so many variables (not data containers, but actual outcome influencers) in solving a problem that you are forced to take a comprehensive view of the issue and consider all of the options for causes. I think this approach to problem solving is applicable to many aspects of life and can help keep you from one track thinking. It has been both challenging and rewarding for me.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>When you have something built and live to the public there is a lot of pride in that.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em>Through this <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/learning%20programming/2012/11/30/learning-programming/">Pathways to Programming</a> interview series, we talk to formerly non-technical people about how they learned to program in a non-traditional way and what they’re doing now. If you’ve taken your own unconventional path to becoming a programmer, we’d love to hear about it. Send a <a href="mailto:scott.james@devbootcamp.com">short email</a> and let’s talk.</em></p>
