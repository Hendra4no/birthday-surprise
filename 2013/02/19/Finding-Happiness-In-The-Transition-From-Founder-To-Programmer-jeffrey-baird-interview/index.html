You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<h2><strong><em>"I am challenged every day, which I have never found in a job before now. This makes me much happier."</em></strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>-- Jeffrey Baird</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/brooklyn-bridge.jpg" alt="Jeffrey Baird Dev Bootcamp"/></p>
<p>This week we talk to Jeffrey Baird, ruby developer at <a href="http://www.medivo.com/">Medivo</a>, where he builds software that helps patients manage their health and make doctor visits doctor more productive.</p>
<p>After first training for his third mate's license, Jeffrey charted a new course and founded Kngroo, a location-based app that turned metropolitan landscapes into virtual gaming platforms. He started learning to code to understand enough to hire a good developer, and before he knew it he got hooked and was coding all day. We talk with him about that journey, why he wishes he spent more time building and less time reading, and what it's like to love going to work everyday.</p>

<h2>Who are you? Tell us about yourself.</h2>
<p>My name is Jeffrey Baird and I am a ruby developer in Manhattan for Medivo, a health care management company built on Rails.</p>
<h2>What were you doing before? What made you decide to code?</h2>
<p>Before I started coding I ran a startup called <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/kngroo">Kngroo</a> which went through a Tampa, FL accelerator called <a href="http://gazellelab.com/">Gazelle Lab</a>. Before that I was working on cargo ships, training for my Third Mate’s License.</p>
<p>I didn’t particularly decide to code. While I was working on my startup I wanted to learn a little bit, at least enough to hire a decent programmer. I would commit to spending an hour a night. One hour would become two; two became three; and before I knew it I was spending eight – ten hours a day coding. I was hooked.</p>
<h2>How did you learn? What resources were most valuable? What surprised you?</h2>
<p>I started with JavaScript and quickly moved to Ruby since there was more of a community around that in Tampa.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I learned by doing.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I used Chris Pine’s <a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/">Learn to Program</a>, <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/ruby/">Pragmatic Studio’s Learn Ruby video course</a>, I listened the <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/">Ruby Rogues</a> (every episode), subscribed to Rails Casts, read Ryan Bigg’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rails-3-Action-Ryan-Bigg/dp/1935182277">Rails 3 in Action</a> and participated in my local Ruby meetup group.</p>
<h2>What have you been doing with it?</h2>
<p>I’ve been working for Medivo. Now that I've settled into my job, I'm looking forward to getting involved in some open-source projects.</p>
<h2>What were some mistakes you made or challenges you faced?</h2>
<blockquote><p><em>I think my biggest mistake was reading more than building.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I like to read, and I read a lot of material over the course of my introduction to Ruby. This served me fairly well. However, now that I have a job I have less time to start a project. I wish I had done this prior to getting a job so I could focus on maintaining it.</p>
<h2>What were some of the biggest obstacles you found outside the actual learning?</h2>
<p>The biggest challenge was getting the confidence to put my (awful) code out publicly. I figured it was the only way to get feedback on my work. It ended up being one of the best things I ever did.</p>
<h2>Is your life different now, emotionally speaking?</h2>
<blockquote><p><em>I am challenged every day, which I have never found in a job before now. This makes me much happier.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t hurt that job prospects remain excellent.</p>
<h2>What's next for you?</h2>
<p>I plan on staying with Medivo for the foreseeable future. I would also like to find a good open source project to contribute to (contact me if you know of one that needs help).</p>
<h2>Any closing thoughts for those thinking about learning to program?</h2>
<blockquote><p><em>There aren’t shortcuts.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>After my blog post on <a href="http://learnwithjeff.com/blog/2012/08/21/how-to-get-a-job-as-a-developer-in-less-than-six-months/">How to Get A Job as a Developer in Less Than Six Months</a>, I got a lot of email asking about ways they could do it without so much work.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It won’t be the same for everyone, but there aren’t shortcuts. You have to work your ass off.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em>Through this <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/learning%20programming/2012/11/30/learning-programming/">Pathways to Programming</a> interview series, we talk to formerly non-technical people about how they learned to program in a non-traditional way and what they’re doing now. If you’ve taken your own unconventional path to becoming a programmer, we’d love to hear about it. Send a <a href="mailto:scott.james@devbootcamp.com">short email</a> and let’s talk.</em></p>
