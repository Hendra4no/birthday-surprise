You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<p>Dev Bootcamp students come to us from everywhere. Beyond a common passion for coding, everyone's story is unique. In our <em>"Boots on the Ground"</em> series we invite the boots who are with us now to tell some of their personal story.</p>

<h2>What got you interested in coding?</h2>
<p>I was living in Japan for two years, completing my doctorate in classical Japanese and Chinese literature, and started teaching myself C as a diversion from my research. A central part of my academic work was analyzing the language of classical texts in meticulous detail. Basically, I would start by identifying the characters in a text, then consider how those characters fit together, and then finally think about the larger rhetorical meanings.</p>
<p>While learning C, I was amazed at the similarity with reading a foreign language. One must first understand all the syntax of a computer language, then how the various pieces fit together, and finally how a program itself functions. In both cases, attention to detail reigns supreme. I was basically instantly in love with coding because not only was I doing much the same work as I did in my academic life, I was actually creating something at the end of the day. That mix of analyzing language and creating software remains fascinating to me. And so I was hooked.</p>
<h2>What was your path to Dev Bootcamp?</h2>
<p>I was just south of Tokyo when the 9.0 magnitude Tohoku earthquake struck on March 11, 2011. I spent the weekend scared to death, literally worrying about nuclear fallout while feeling awful about the horrible tragedy. I remember watching as Google and other web sites responded by putting up applications to locate missing persons, and wishing that I could do something myself to help.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, as I stumbled onto C and the world of programming, I felt an ever stronger conviction that I needed to do something which could have a more immediate and positive effect on the world around me. I had been drawn to studying history and literature for the grandiose philosophical appeal of it, but gradually realized that if I were to work as a professor, such knowledge would have only a limited appeal and would ultimately reach only a handful of students.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, software and the internet, on the other hand, has this amazing potential to transform the world for the better. In my opinion, solving the momentous problems of the next hundred years will hinge upon the power of global networks and software. And in whatever small and insignificant way possible, I want to be one of the people building software to bring about those solutions.</p>
<p>As I realized all this, I was continuing to learn on my own as much as possible, but found that my learning curve was flattening out. I had thoughts about getting a CS degree, but after a decade of academic training, more time in the university didn’t make much sense. When I saw DevBootcamp, I loved the emphasis on empathy and hands-on learning. I signed up almost immediately afterwards.</p>
<p>There’s a famous Mark Twain quote: <em>“Don’t let school get in the way of your education.”</em> I like this quote because it reminds me that in spite of all the great things one can learn in school, school is not the only place to go for more education. And for me, DevBootcamp is a great example.</p>
<h2>How is the transition going?</h2>
<p>One of my concerns was, after coding on my own for a year and a half, that there would be some kiddie-paddling. And, wow, was I wrong. I’ve never been pushed harder. The people at DBC have put a tremendous amount of thought into the program. After these nine-weeks, I sense that I will be far beyond where I would have been after another year of self-study.</p>
