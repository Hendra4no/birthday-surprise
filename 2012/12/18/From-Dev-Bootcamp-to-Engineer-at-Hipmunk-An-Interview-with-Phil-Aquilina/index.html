You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<h2><strong><em>"I've been programming for a little over a year now and it's been one of the best years of my life because of it."</em></strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>-- Phil Aquilina</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="http://devbootcamp.github.com/imgs/blog/devbootcamp-class-talk-new.jpg" alt="Pathways to Programming"/></p>
<p>This week we talk to Phil Aquilina, software engineer at <a href="http://www.hipmunk.com">Hipmunk</a>, a new travel search site working to take the agony out of travel planning.</p>
<p>Aquilina's coding journey started when he wondered if he could turn the Excel scripting he did on the side into a career he loved. After a year full of solo coffee shop sessions, Ruby meetups, and Dev Bootcamp classes, he's doing just that. And it's inspiring to know that after studying Ruby on Rails at Dev Bootcamp he made a smooth transition to programming in Python at Hipmunk, showing that the key to getting started is understanding the fundamentals of software engineering and maintaining a beginner's mind throughout the process.</p>

<h2>Who are you? Tell us about yourself.</h2>
<p>My name is Phil Aquilina. I'm a software engineer at <a href="http://www.hipmunk.com">Hipmunk</a>. I've been programming for a little over a year now and it's been one of the best years of my life because of it.</p>
<h2>What were you doing before and what made you decide to code?</h2>
<p>I was a mechanical engineer at a firm of more than 2000 people. Yikes. I started learning how to code to automate some of my daily Excel chores and really started getting into it. I sent the scripts out to my coworkers, got feedback from them, and starting making bigger, better, more badass programs.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I started redefining my job around that and then one day I was like, "What if I just did this as a career?"</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>How did you learn? What were the resources that were most valuable? What surprised you about learning?</h2>
<p>When I first started, I found a Ruby meetup in San Francisco. At the time, I was commuting up from Palo Alto after work to make it there, which was tough, but I never once thought it wasn't worth it. By coincidence, one of my future Dev Bootcamp teachers was the guy who hosted it. He had been an architect before becoming a programmer, and was the inspiration for convincing myself I could do this.</p>
<p>I've never been a disciplined student. When it came to coding though, I could sit in a coffee shop and time would melt away. It was a completely new experience to me and this has opened up doors to learning other new things. I've found my abilities to learn anything have increased tremendously over the last year.</p>
<h2>What have you been doing with it?</h2>
<p>Most of my time is spent making Hipmunk that much more awesome. I work on the backend team, learning from the best programmers in the world on a daily basis. Lately, I've been getting into Coffeescript, so I'll practice that when I get home.</p>
<h2>What were some of the biggest mistakes you made?</h2>
<p>Over-focusing on theory first. It was a form of procrastination I think. I read the entire Ruby Pickaxe book before I built anything substational. That's a big book. Theory is great but you need experience to anchor all that knowledge onto something. Just start building. When you encounter a problem, learn how to overcome it then. I guarantee those lessons will stick better.</p>
<p>Teach (or blog). I learned this one way late in the game.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You are always going to be one step ahead of somebody. Find that person and get them to where you're at. You're going to quickly realize just how much and how little you know about a topic trying to explain it to people.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>What were some of the biggest obstacles you found outside the actual learning?</h2>
<p>Time is always a tough constraint. Programming is not an activity you can easily jump in and out of. It takes longer, contiguous blocks of time and focus. This can have a significant effect on your loved ones who want and deserve your attention too. My best advice here is to try to set aside time for them and activities besides programming.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Balance is healthy, and there's more to life than code. And I'm beginning to find my code quality goes up when I walk away from it for a bit.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>How do you find your life different emotionally speaking?</h2>
<p>Where do I start? I wake up excited to start the day. I'm proud of the work I do, and every time some of my code goes into our app, my heart does a little jump for joy. Sometimes, I go to our site and I think to myself, I'm so lucky to be part of this, working with people that really want to produce something useful to the world. When I come home, I get to build beautiful and meaningful things of my own.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>My general approach to anything in life is now, "Given enough time and effort, I can do anything." That discovery has been life changing, and I've never enjoyed my life more than I do right now.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Where are you headed?</h2>
<p>I want to start my own company one day but I'm currently focusing on becoming the best developer I can be. CEOs are a dime a dozen, but really good engineers are hard to come by. This is the first time I've truly wanted to become a master of something so I'm going to roll with that feeling.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>When I started coding last year, there's no way I would have seen myself here. I really can't believe how far I've come since then, so I'm very excited for what the future holds.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Any closing thoughts for people thinking about learning to program?</h2>
<p>Programming has this aura surrounding it that I think scares most people away. It seems inaccessible and only meant for technical people. Yes, there are certainly times when it feels that way but for every minute of that, there's 59 minutes of it being more like art. More like writing a story. The first few months are difficult, as learning anything completely new will be, but keep at it.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There's this moment, an "I know Kung Fu" type of moment, where you realize you can learn anything and build anything you want. That's a powerful notion right there.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="mailto:philaquilina@gmail.com"><em>Email me!</em></a> Let's grab some coffee, code for a bit, swap stories, build something awesome. Someone once helped me get started in this world, I'd love to pass that forward.</p>
