You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
Bootcamp Education, Inc. (the "Company," "we," "us," "our"), knows that you care
about how your personal information is used and shared, and takes your
privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our
Privacy Policy. By visiting the Company's website at www.devbootcamp.com
or any of Company's other websites, applications, domain names or other
linked pages, (collectively the "Website"), or using any of our services,
you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in
this Privacy Policy. By using the Website, you are consenting to have your
personal data transferred to and processed in the United States. You post
any Content (as that term is defined in the Company's Terms of Service
located at <a href="http://davebootcamp.net/terms_of_service">http://davebootcamp.net/terms_of_service</a>
) on the Website at your own risk. Although we may allow you to set
privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no
security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the
actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information.
Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that Content you post on the
Website will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible
for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained
on the Website. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal,
copies of Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if
other users have copied or stored your Content.
</p>
<p>
Any improper collection or misuse of Content or other information
accessible on the Website is a violation of the Company's Terms of Service
and should be reported to <a href="mailto:hello@devbootcamp.com">hello@devbootcamp.com</a>.
</p>
<h2>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy explains how Company collects and uses information
from its users who access the Website and use our services, including
Company's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal
Information"). Also, this Privacy Policy covers Company's treatment of any
Personal Information that Company's business partners share with Company,
or that you provide to the Company through a third party website using a
Company application. This policy does not apply to websites or practices
of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that
Company does not employ or manage.
</p>
<h2>HOW IS STUDENTS' PERSONAL INFORMATION TREATED?</h2>
<p>
If you are a minor (under the age of 18), you may only use this service
and disclose Personal Information with your parent or guardian's express
consent. Company collects limited Personal Information from students
("Students's Personal Information"), but only where that student's
school, district, and/or teacher has contracted with Company to collect
Students's Personal Information from students for the use and benefit of
the learning environment. Company requires schools, districts, and/or
teachers to obtain parental consent from students' parents before
collecting any such Students's Personal Information. If you are a
student, please do not send any Students's Personal Information about
yourself to us, other than what we request from you when you sign up for
the Services. In the event that we learn that we have collected
Students's Personal Information from a student without parental consent
being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we
learn a student has provided us Students's Personal Information beyond
what we request when he or she signs up for the Services, we will delete
that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student
may have provided us Students's Personal Information beyond what is
requested when signing up for the Services, or that a student's school,
district, or teacher has not obtained parental consent, please contact
us at <a href="mailto:hello@devbootcamp.com">hello@devbootcamp.com</a>.
Hereinafter, references to "Personal Information" shall apply to
personal information of individual Website users who are not student
registrants. References to "Students's Personal Information" shall only
apply to personal information of student users of the Website. General
references to "information" shall apply to all users.
</p>
<h2>WHAT INFORMATION DOES COMPANY DISPLAY OR COLLECT?</h2>
<p>
When you use the Website, you may set up your personal profile, send
messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through
various channels, depending on the category of user ("User Category")
you are, and as permitted by the functionality of the Website. The
information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve
our services, and, in some cases, to allow our users to set up a user
account and profile through the Website. In most cases, we retain such
information so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages
you have sent. When you update information, we usually keep a backup
copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable
reversion to the prior version of that information. In addition to the
foregoing, we collect the following types of information from our users.
</p>
<h3>Information You Provide to Us:</h3>
<p>
We receive and store any information you knowingly enter on the Website,
whether via computer, mobile phone, other wireless device, or that you
provide to us in any other way. This information may include Personal
Information such as your name, email address, photograph, and your
school affiliation, Students's Personal Information (which shall be
limited to your name and the contact information necessary to receive
notifications via the Website from your teacher, school, and/or district
("Notifications")), and any other information necessary for us to
provide our services. You may choose not to provide us with certain
information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of
our features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such
purposes as responding to your requests for certain information,
products and services, customizing the content you see, and
communicating with you about specials and new features. You may modify
or remove your Personal Information or Students's Personal Information
identified below at any time by logging into your account and accessing
features to edit your classes and/or account information.
</p>
<h3>Information Collected Automatically:</h3>
<p>
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact
with the Website or our services. Company automatically receives and
records information on our server logs from your browser including your
IP address, Company cookie information, and the page you requested. We
also record the details of your activity on the Website. This
information is not Personal Information or Students's Personal
Information.
</p>
<p>
Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as
the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components,
similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular
show. Company only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a
statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you
personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how
often users use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the
Website appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those
services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate
information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our
site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also
understand how often people use our partners' services and the Website
to help provide you with an optimal online experience.
</p>
<h3>Email and Text Message Communications:</h3>
<p>
If you provide us your email address or phone number, we may send you
email or text message communications. By maintaining a Company account
and/or failing to opt out of the receipt of information hereunder, you
acknowledge that you may receive e-mail or text messages on your phone
or mobile communications device, and that the receipt of such messages
may cause you to incur usage charges or other fees or costs in
accordance with your wireless or data service plan. Any and all such
charges, fees, or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult
with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees, or
costs may apply. We may receive a confirmation when you open an email
from Company if your computer supports this type of program. Company
uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and
helpful.
</p>
<h2>WHAT ABOUT COOKIES?</h2>
<p>
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's
hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your
browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by
how many people. Company cookies do not collect Personal Information or
Students's Personal Information, and we do not combine the general
information collected through cookies with other Personal Information or
Students's Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your
screen name or email address is. Most browsers have an option for
turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from
accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of
your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new
cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the
cookies activated, however, because you will not be able to log in or
use many of the Website's most attractive features without cookies
enabled.
</p>
<h2>WILL COMPANY SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR STUDENTS' PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</h2>
<p>
Personal Information and Students's Personal Information about our users
is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your
Personal Information or Students's Personal Information to anyone.

Information in personally identifiable form as described below. Again,

</p>
<h2>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</h2>
<p>

affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the
Website (either alone or jointly with us). We may, for example, sell
products or provide services jointly with affiliated businesses, or work
with third party websites to enhance your online experience. These
transactions or services may or may not be commercial in nature; if you
are a student, we will not share your Students's Personal Information in
connection with any commercial third party transaction or service. You
can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a
transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information or
Students's Personal Information with that affiliated business only to
the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. Such
services may include the ability for you to automatically transmit
information you input on the Website to your profile or account on a
third party website, or to automatically transmit information you input
on a third party website to your Website profile. We have no control
over the policies and practices of third party websites as to privacy or
anything else, so if you choose to allow the automatic transmissions

Personal Information for the above purposes. Communication About the

business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the
assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge
that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of Company may
continue to use your Personal Information and Students's Personal
