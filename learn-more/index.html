You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<h1>The Dev Bootcamp Way</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Hands on</h3>
<h2>Learning</h2>
<p>
Dev Bootcamp is not a typical classroom. Think of it more as apprenticeship or a workshop intensive.
You will be learning by doing and building, not just by sitting back and listening.
We set up bootcamp to closely resemble a real work environment.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Flipped</h3>
<h2>Classroom</h2>
<p>
Most classes give instruction to the group, then have people practice on their own.
At Bootcamp, it's the other way around: you get instruction through a curated set of videos, books and tutorials.
Practice happens by applying the theory in group projects.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Intensive</h3>
<h2>Learning</h2>
<p>
We pack a LOT of material into a very short timeframe and set the bar very high for you.
Come prepared to work harder than you've ever worked in your life.
You will go to sleep dreaming of code. Fun? Yes. Piece of cake? Nope.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Engaged</h3>
<h2>Mentorship</h2>
<p>
A big part of learning to be a developer is learning how to get unstuck. You don't have to do it alone.
You will have plenty of one-on-one attention from mentors who can help you navigate the hard parts.
</p>
