You qualify for a $500 scholarship if you're female, a veteran of the U.S. Military, or from an ethnic minority group underrepresented in the software engineering field (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander).
The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population.
We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are.

<p>Who is the best teacher you've ever had? What made them great? Which lessons did you learn from them, whether or not those lessons were written on the syllabus?</p>
<p>These and other questions are on my mind quite a bit these days. I like hearing stories of incredible teachers because it helps me clarify what exactly it is that I can look for. Over the next few months, I'm <strong><a href="http://devbootcamp.com/jobs/">hiring a new team of teachers</a> for our New York City location</strong>. This is not a simple endeavor.</p>
<p>In the process of recruiting and interviewing, I've noticed that <em>most people have no idea how we teach here at Dev Bootcamp</em>. When we post that we are hiring teachers, that can be interpreted in a variety of ways. Are we looking for lecturers or tutors? Guides or explorers? Masters of a particular craft or facilitators of an exceptional learning environment? The answer to all of these questions is "yes".</p>
<p>Which is, admittedly, exceptionally confusing. So let me attempt to clarify just <strong>what it means to be a teacher at DBC</strong>.</p>
<p>In broad terms, being a teacher here means guiding and activating student learning, deepening one's own knowledge of education and programming through deliberate practice, and building out a new kind of educational model with a community of like-minded and passionate people. Let's tackle each of those in turn.</p>
<h2>Teacher as Guide</h2>
<p>Information is cheap and ubiquitous. What is rare and valuable is the skill to discover, filter, and integrate the most useful and pertinent information. A teacher who merely acts as a deliverer of information is not very useful, while other elements of teaching are becoming increasingly important: mentoring, counseling, and guiding, to name a few.</p>
<p>Guiding and activating student learning is the abstraction layered on myriad concrete activities designed to provide students with the richest project-based learning environment we can create.</p>
<p>These activities include coding challenges, group discussions, topical lectures, guided inquiry, feedback, reflection, mentorship, modeling by example... and quite a few more. Being a teacher means having access to a large toolbox of pedagogical tools and methodologies which can be applied to the appropriate learning opportunity.</p>
<p>The crucial distinction here is that teachers at Dev Bootcamp prioritize student exploration and discovery over transmission of knowledge. In other words, we believe that what makes a teacher an expert is not so much the size of their vault of relevant knowledge and experience (although that is certainly valuable and valued), but is rather their ability to nurture students' ability to seek out, discover, and integrate knowledge, wherever the source of that knowledge may be.</p>
<p>To put it simply, a teacher doesn't copy and paste knowledge. They lead and facilitate the exploration and discovery of it.</p>
<p>This is why I prefer the analogy of a trail guide over the archetype of a classroom instructor. A guide's job is to prepare their team for the unexpected, to give them the tools to survive and adapt in new terrain and unfamiliar conditions. A guide who does nothing more than teach you how to follow a well-marked trail and survive in temperate weather is not much of a guide.</p>
<h2>Teacher as Learner</h2>
<p>Occupying the role of a teacher is a position with no small amount of authority and leadership. A good teacher is a good leader in the sense that they are empathetic and demonstrate the qualities they encourage their students to emulate.</p>
<p>A teacher who demonstrates curiosity, humility in the face of vast unknowns, integrity in their words and actions, a passion for learning, and the perseverance to solve complicated problems will be more effective in provoking these behaviors in their students.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that we look for teachers who don't see themselves as being at the zenith of their education, but who see education as a lifelong practice. As best we can, we try to nurture an environment where teachers can learn openly in front of their students and where students are encouraged and empowerd to take on the role of a teacher to themselves and their peers.</p>
<p>At this point I am realizing that my claims must sound quite hallow and high-minded. It is all well and good to proclaim intent, but do we actually walk the talk?</p>
<p>Well, yes. We do. And we have a long way to go and we are constantly improving. Two things we are doing right now:</p>
<p><strong>Paid professional development.</strong> In between periods of teaching students full-time, teachers at Dev Bootcamp are encouraged to take 3 weeks of paid professional development time to improve themselves as teachers and as programmers. Instead of expecting teachers to learn on their own time, we aim to establish persistent learning as an integral part of the structure of the organization.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback and transparency.</strong> Feedback is a fundamental theme throughout Dev Bootcamp, for students and teachers. Students are taught how to give specific, actionable, and kind feedback. Everyone practices soliciting, giving, and receiving feedback. It is a skill. We believe it to be one of the most useful skills. As teachers, we practice that skill and use it in just about every interaction and activity, cultivating an environment where the status quo is vibrant growth.</p>
<p>Is it a bit chaotic? Well, yes. Intentionally so. Evolution happens at the fringes. Staying safe, dry, and comfortable is antithetical to real learning.</p>
<h2>Teacher as Innovator</h2>
<p>The final piece of being a teacher at Dev Bootcamp is a bit more nebulous. It stems from the fact that our business is sailing into relatively uncharted territory.</p>
<p>That sounds presumptuous. Let me clarify what I mean.</p>
<p>Apprenticeship is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship#Development">not new</a>. In fact, it may well be one of the oldest forms of structured, skill-based education. So in the sense that we are a type of apprenticeship program, that is not new territory. Trade schools have been doing this for a while, with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>Likewise, creative ways of teaching people computer programming is not that new either. A lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">really</a> <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/">smart</a> <a href="http://www.papert.org/">people</a> have worked on fascinating new educational methods to teach what is increasingly becoming an essential skill for the modern economy.</p>
<p>Within the established academic world there have also been all kinds of innovative ideas sprouting up from creative clusters like <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/">MIT's Media Lab</a> and the <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/">ITP program at NYU</a>. A simplistic view of educational institutions as backwards and obsolete doesn't give proper credence to the real innovations occuring within the academy.</p>
<p>As much as we respect and admire them, we do not quite fit into any of these three categories. At Dev Bootcamp, we <em>are</em> doing something different. We <em>are</em> innovating.</p>
<p><strong>We practice and envision an education that addresses students as whole people whose personal, social, and technical growth are interdependent and best addressed holistically.</strong></p>
<p>Unless I'm sorely mistaken, most schools don't approach learning in this way.</p>
<p>In moving towards this relatively unknown domain, we have to maintain an innovator's mind. Failing often and learning from our failures. Becoming <em>connoisseurs of our own mistakes</em>, to quote the philosopher <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett">Daniel Dennett</a>.</p>
<p>As teachers are at the core of our culture, they are crucial components of this innovative endeavor. Teachers are experimenting, ideating, creating, innovating. We may not always agree on where to go, but we share commitment to a common goal: creating the best immersive learning environment possible.</p>
